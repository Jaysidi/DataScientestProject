The Outer Worlds,PlayStation 4,499,499,"Quick review because I'm really enjoying this game. Outer Worlds is the Fallout 4 Bethesda should have gifted us with... but in space. It's charming, whacky and random, which is what I expect for these types of games. It's very much influenced by such games as New Vegas and Kotor, maybe a bit too much, but that really isn't a bad thing. If you like these two games, you'll love Outer Worlds.",10,2019-10-25,UnionJack0714,False

Silent Hill HD Collection,PlayStation 3,52,52,THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE PATCH AS I DID NOT BUY SILENT HILL HD COLLECTION DAY ONE!! That being said I didn't have many problems with this game like all the day one purchasers out there! So...first the **** graphics:silent hill 2 graphics just plain **** seems that hijinks skipped the work of making silent hill 2 look good!? Silent hill 3 on the other hand looks great better than when I first played it actually! Gameplay:as usual the gameplay(I.E. combat) is clumsy & frustrating but not in a bad way like downpour that forces you to turn into a total coward & run from basically ALL **** clumsy combat represents how normal people would encounter horrible monsters so its not that bad once you figure that out. Story:silent hill 2 &3 are nearly unmatched when it comes to great story telling(including silent hill 1) as these games show how past developers actually went the extra mile to have players stay interested in the story! Its ESPECIALLY noticeable in silent hill 2 as James have the most engaging/enthralling story & unique experience while in silent hill(my opinion) as he suffers the most & unfortunately has a sad fate waiting in the end but heather's story is entertaining as well!! Characters:as stated previously these are two of the most  interesting characters in the silent hill series(including Harry from silent hill 1) unlike Murphy in downpour who's an uninteresting **** bag devoid of any attention grabbing emotion or backstory!! Enemy design: as usual each protagonist has certain enemies that represents their fears in some way(James=pyramid head...heather=dark alessa) they are horribly disfigured & disgusting to look at unlike downpour who's enemy design look like humans in bad ****!! Fear factor: these classics remind me of the good old days of survival horror games that don't exist today. These games will scare you as you walk down music-less hallways only hearing the twisted howls & screams of unseen enemies! Once again this is something not seen or not done correctly by new generation games which is why these games are sorley needed today! Now for the bad:the controls are last gen(its fine with me) so new gen gamers might find it difficult to play. Combat: as stated earlier its clumsy but that's a good thing here it lets the players experience how normal people struggle againts demons from hell(purgatory?)frame rate/skips: while it isn't insanely constant like in downpour which happens every 7-12seconds in that steamy pile **** it is present in this game but as stated its VERY playable.people complain about the fog effects/over all brightness but to be **** only possible to say that if you have two ps2's each playing sh 2-sh3 & a ps3 with sh2 hd-sh3hd playing side by side so I don't see the difference. All in all the good out weight the bad here & if your a true fan of silent hill 2 & 3 then you will pick up this priceless collection seeing how survival horror in this noob generation of gaming is all but dead!! 9/10,9,2012-10-09,ilovegames32,False
Dying Light 2 Stay Human,PlayStation 5,1241,500,"This game is really good. I see what they have done in 7 years, and it's amazing. Personally, I love the combat. Parkour is wonderful.

Knack,PlayStation 4,334,334,"This game is an appalling disaster of bland and restrictive level design, repetitive and clunky gameplay, uninteresting and predictable narrative, and an overall botched attempt at reviving the lost genre of 3D platforming.  Knack's ability to scale and vary his powers are so contextually driven that it's pointless to give it any thought, as it barely adjusts gameplay, and everything scales with you, so there's only 1-2 sections of being giant knack that you actually feel giant.  Enemies are hardly skilled, and the game makes up for their lackluster behavior by making Knack have the defenses of a wet Kleenex, and overwhelming the player with an annoying amount of enemies.

The game hardly is a platformer, as the level rarely scales vertically in so few sections that most FPS's outdo them, and it barely makes for a brawler, as the fighting is so limited that you spend most your time mashing Square or X and Square.  Most of the game is spent determining attack order, and dying due to your wretched controls.  secrets in this game are essentially just hidden rooms in breakaway walls, 80% of which are fairly easy to find, and consist of assembling parts to ""Upgrades"" that you'll never have the desire to go back and use, as a single playthrough will leave you with the entire story.  Seeing as the game lacks nearly any replayability, Once completed, you'll be hard-pressed to have any other use for it.

I understand that this was meant to be a love letter to games like Jak and Daxter, Banjo-Kazooie, and Super Mario 64, but this failed on a massive scale.  No part of this resembles them, and even with the corridor gameplay of Crash Bandicoot (Another game from Mark Cerny), it at least had a wider range of play, better level design, and a far more fun overall feel.  From a game 17 years younger.  This isn't acceptable for a game of this generation, nor would it have been on the PlayStation 1.  About the only thing that's noteworthy are the graphics and particle effects, neither of which are terribly difficult to get wrong when dealing with the cartoon-like style of Knack.

I understand if they wanted to create a game that could appeal to younger audiences and show that even the casual market can enjoy the PS4.  However, this was a failure in a massive way, and wouldn't be worth half its cost.  I really wanted to like this game, as 3D platforming is such a dire love of mine.  This just didn't do it.  At all.",3,2014-04-23,gazingforth,False

Metaphor: ReFantazio,PC,100,100,"Gameplay is significantly improved and streamlined compared to previous titles, but the story is very bland, unimaginative, and incredibly safe. Every twist was highly predictable just as the antagonists were, and moments that were clearly supposed to be tearjerking each fell flat on their face like dominoes. Each iteration of the franchise seems to be a watered down version and it become noticable with P5 and severe with Metaphor. Clearly to investors, Persona has become too big to fail, hence the reluctance to do anything interesting which may change the playing field.

ARK: Survival Evolved,PlayStation 4,148,148,"This game has a great setting, scope and actually offers some of the best (if not the best) experience for its genre, but also some of the most infuriating moments in gaming. Wildcard Devs clearly have good vision and ambition but its just never backed up a similar level of technical capability to deliver it.
On one hand it offers an unforgiving grinding survival experience which does feel rewarding when you achieve things, and any loss or setback is felt a lot. That would normally be fine and part of the challenge/attraction of the game, but at the same time the bugs and technical issue in the game will often lead to you losing many dozens of hours worth of progress/work randomly and on multiple occasions. On PvE you may constantly lose everything whilst not even playing the game which is infuriating.

PvP and PvE are completely different gaming experiences altogether, but both require an incredible level of continuous time investment (like having to log in daily or every couple of days and spent time just feeding the tamed animals!). You can't pick up and drop this game as you please unless you do single player, which is really not to anywhere near as interesting or rewarding. The game is really meant to be played with groups of people to get the most out of it.

All in all the game can be a great experience and is incredibly addictive, however due to the technical shortcomings, quality controls that have never been addressed, it will always be a good, but not great game, which is a shame to see.",4,2018-12-12,Widowmakernt,False

It has many technical issues though (bugs, clippings etc) but this is quite frequent in the open world games. I personally like the weather effects (though raindrops should be less ... thick ... if you know what I mean) and I  hate the sea (the water's FX remind me of a PS2 game). I also hate the songs played on the radio so I always keep the radio off. But overall I really like this game since I'm a big fan of the open world genre. Forget about the PS4 version you see in YouTube, which is superior and consider this as a nice game for your X360's engine and go for it.

Pokemon Legends: Arceus,Nintendo Switch,1434,500,"It's Breath of the Wild meets Pokemon, but with a bit of Monster Hunter mixed in.

And I love it! This is the closest we've been to an open-world Pokemon game that I've daydreamed about since I was a kid. Arceus delivers Pokemon Snap- levels of environmental immersion as a mainline RPG -- you will encounter pokemon walking/swimming/flying around in their natural habitats instead of randomly encountering something while blindly walking through tall grass. You can summon your own pokemon to gather berries, mine shards, and engage a wild pokemon all within a few steps without waiting for flow-stopping animations and transitions. It's truly like playing a simulation of the anime.

Issues that I had: Most bothersome to me might be the fact that you have to fast travel back to the hub city in order to go to the next zone (like Monster Hunter). It makes the world feel a lot smaller since it's just a bunch of disconnected environments instead of a huge continent. Also, no mounts at the hub city makes traveling a drag. Now for my minor issues. Some of the sound effects are clearly ripped from BotW, such as the male character sounding exactly like Link when he tucks and rolls. Maybe it was meant to be a callback, but personally I wish they didn't recycle assets like that. The graphics are also a little rough around the edges here and there. Some things like rocks and trees disappear if you slightly turn the camera. And the game sometimes draws pokemon at its max spawn distance, but animates them at like 2 FPS which makes them look bizarre against the more smooth and lively world closer to you. If the hardware is struggling to do this, just don't draw the pokemon that far!

Anyways, I'd give this a 8 out of 10. Rough around the edges in parts, but this is definitely a Pokemon formula I want them to polish and perfect. I don't think I'll be able to stomach the old style of pokemon games again. If Nintendo can somehow cram in a more modern setting with pokemon centers, cities, (etc) AND open world pokemon walking about onto the little Switch cartridge, it'd be absolutely perfect. It may be possible that the Switch may not have the horsepower to truly get to the next level, though.",8,2022-01-30,Brusky,False
Battlefield V,PC,1041,500,"Battlefield V, it's not a 10/10 game, not even an 8 or 9.

For one, the announcer and the whole UI layout feels and looks like Star Wars: Battlefront which is hilarious.

I personally LOVE how EA/DICE is making us pay $60 for a missing game mode they promised, Battle Royale (which we are getting 'next year' lol) and many features just missing. You can't customize your character in-game/server, groups/platoons don't exist and so many more features just lacking. What is this? An Early Access game on Steam? Why are we missing core features that the Battlefield series always had? Then you have weapons, they just feel ""squishy"" against enemies. It takes a full magazine to kill someone or if you use a sniper and shoot them straight at the chest it doesn't kill someone. Sometimes even a headshot won't kill a player instantly. The health idea in this game is just stupid. Why are there health packs on players? Battlefield is team orientated. Nope, not this Battlefield. You have health packs like Call of Duty now just to replenish your health. No need for teammates to go Medic for health or even Support for ammo. Can I also mention that DICE censors 'curse words' in-game text chat? Rated 'M' game and we can't call our own horrible team bad words because it may hurt them. Finally, sadly another year without Battlelog. Why? I want detailed statistics, no one wants that crap website companion or app.

Want to play this game? Play on 'Hardcore' servers created by the community. Official servers with DICE's own rule sets are trash.

Battlefield 4 is better and more balanced, Battlefield V is catering to more ""casual"" players. EA/DICE want that Call of Duty fan base too much rather than on just expanding on what Battlefield is and what they created from the start. You aren't missing out much if you don't play or buy this. If you really want it, wait for a sale. It will probably be like $30 by next year like Battlefield 1.

I bought every Battlefield game, played each one (ranging from Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC) and I have to say one thing. I personally would have liked to have Battlefield: Bad Company 3 this year or I would have rather taken Battlefield Hardline 2, instead we got Battlefield V.

Sid Meier's Civilization V,PC,597,500,"Настоятельно рекомендую к покупке. В общем-то, я не знаю чего можно написать о Циве такого, все знают, что такое Цива, но выделю моменты, которые мне НЕ понравились.

1. Боевые действия невыгодны.
Может я неправильно воюю, но куда проще нафармить злата и подружиться со всеми взятками и уступками, чем тратить деньги на армию, время не перекидывание войск и вообще все осуждают войну. Мой милитарист негодуетЪ

2. Убрали статистику в конце игры, а ту, что оставили, порезали до примитива и это весьма плохо!

3. Дипломатия здесь сводится к тому, кто больше заплатит. Можно, например, подкупить все города-государства на выборах ООН и победить в дипломатической победе, даже если вы будете страной-изгоем. Да и вообще, вся дипломатия тут -- один сплошной недостаток.

4. Долгие загрузки. Игра довольна стара и почему она так долго грузится -- мне не понятно.

5. Стратегический режим слишком громоздок, а некоторые значки неинформативны. В 6 с этим, вроде как, получше будет.

6. Шпионаж бесполезен(времени на воровство технологии нужно столько, что к тому моменту вы уже на 10 технологий вперед уйдете), а зачем нужна религия -- я так и не понял, ее единственная польза -- в закупках за очки веры. А, ну и возможность создать веру в Бога-Императора радует.

Если говорить в целом, то 4 часть мне нравилась больше. Может со временем, я смогу снова запустить Циву5 и наконец-то распробую ее сполна и тогда начну ее любить, но пока что 4 лучше. Но это не значит, что пятую часть нужно проигнорировать -- в пятой части много интересных фишек, как то новая система войск или ""артефактов"", которая позволяет создать страну-""курорт"".

Other Notes: The series ARMS has a lot of things going for it. A great cast of fighters, an interesting twist on the fighting genre, good depth with the combat. However, there isn't that much you can do with it. Single play mode has you fight against CPU's in the same style you would when online, and there aren't much online modes, and the ones which are there don't feel engaging enough.

Beyond: Two Souls,PC,100,100,"Technically this seems like a good port to PC (I believe the problems lie in the original product and not the port)
The graphics & actors look great in-game.
There were some nice cues on the soundtrack.
There were *some* moments done well cinematically.
It's a cool feature to have two different orders to play throughout the story.
Plus Elaine Page rocks.

Unfortunately this is where the good stuff ends, and she's ending up being wasted on this mess of a thing.
I think the main problem was playing this after Heavy Rain, which lifted up the expectations quite high in my opinion.
While on Heavy Rain I felt every chapter had a meaning to the big scheme of things, and felt I was getting more and more involved in the story & with the characters, in here I felt nothing like it. Although there is an attempt of clever storytelling when you're playing the ""Original"" order which is actually travelling back and forth along the timeline (a concept which I actaully really like) In Beyond Two Souls it felt there were plenty more of time fillers and inconsistency of vibe and inner sence.

At plenty of times seems like Beyond Two Souls isn't not really sure what it tries to be.
Is it a Game? a Movie? An action-thriller themed thing? Supernatural fiction? Horror? Mystery? An Aliens&Predator tribute? Teenage drama? Feminist-thingy? Not really sure what to think when you're playing Spy-girl and also watching her get abused as a teenager at the same storyline.
The former is, specifically, not necessarily a wrong idea in itself, but in here it's done extremely cliche'd and really actually feels like this product simply scattered around in various directions in a journey of a self discovery.

This game is indeed quite ambitious, I'll give QD that, but while the previous games were also ambitious & never without flaws - that's the first one which managed to truly disappoint me, even though it has much potential.

The story just felt mediocre at best, some of the dialogues were just.. just... not good. Some of the scenes didn't make much sense. With the various ""action phases"" (which, by the way, felt much more frequent here than in previous games) I felt it was usually not too clear where to go next, the controls and camera were ""artistically"" clunky, and at many of the QTE it wasn't clear what was expected of me to do, hence I missed plenty of them, and guess what - it didn't even matter that much.

Which leads me to the next point - for a company such as Quantic Dream which is known for making interactive movies, with various paths, where your choices have consequences, etc.. Beyond Two Souls is extremely linear along its script. There are plenty of chapters throughout the game and where it feels *most* of your actions' consequences are confined within the very same chapter and nowhere else later.

I'm about 90% through the game and I have a feeling this is definitely not about to chage, and not any of the other things I've said.",6,2020-02-07,runner,False

Actual Review:
While I do have issues with this game such as a few of the colossi ****, the camera being obnoxious at times, the horse controlling poorly, the story not connecting with me, some technical issues, and the completion process being miserable (SERIOUSLY DO NOT COMPLETE THIS GAME!!!), it's still mostly enjoyable and I'd still recommend giving it a try, i swear! Especially on the PS4. Mainly because the strong parts of this game are really strong. The OST is great,  the atmosphere made the game more immersive, and most of the colossi are wonderful to fight. These things alone makes finishing this game at least once worth it. They doesn't erase my frustrations with this game and I won't be coming back to it for a long while but check this one out. Just be prepared for some annoyances that may come your way.

Wasteland 2,PC,273,273,"Some people say this is a brilliant Fallout 2 sequel that will be bringing back memories from an era of gaming long forgotten.

The biggest problem with this game is not the combat (which is at most mediocre, and becomes boring to soon), or the graphics that look a little outdated, but the RPG elements that are shallow. Is this even an RPG game ?

You won't feel any real connection to your character. There is little customization, and you decisions don't really matter in the world.

You feel no connection to your party. The characters in your party lack real backstories and are in no way memorable. You don't real care about them as long as they hit the enemies. They don't react to your decisions (btw, are there any real decisions ?!) and they don't interact with the world.

Other problem is the lack of replayability. In theory you have plenty of customization and skills in which to invest your skill points, but in the end you will have to do the same party build if you want to finish the game. Also, there is no synergy between your skills. All you have to do is to disperse the skill points in way you cover everything.

FIFA 21,PlayStation 4,1153,500,"Well... Where to start really...

Worth noting that this game is a definite improvement on FIFA 20, however that’s not saying much because it couldn’t have gotten much worse.

Essentially the same game with a few fine tuned gameplay elements, the game’s passing and players making runs behind does seemed to be a bit of an improvement. Also a nice, albeit subtle, presentation element is the inclusion of traditional songs before games that weren’t previously present: This is the One (Man United); Blue Moon (City), Liquidator (Chelsea).. theyre all there and it’s a nice touch. However, for everything good this FIFA does, at a minimum it does an equal number of things badly... Defending is considerably harder this year, which isn’t necessarily a bit thing as long as there was reasoning behind it. However, a lot of the tackling doesn’t make sense and the AI does nothing to help you in situations where it usually would.

Presentation wise, despite what I said before, seems to be lagging at this point. The same reused animations for the last 6 years, along with commentary that’s in desperate need of innovation... also, a small point - Man United walk out of the OT tunnel on the wrong side?... like, this is very menial but Jesus Christ it’s a basic unnecessary error. You only have to watch a United game to see they walk out on the opposite side...

As for the goalkeeping, don’t get me started. A top keeper can go from making an unbelievable close range save to watching a slow 40 yard shot just meander in without making an attempt to save, very odd.

What’s also painfully evident at this point is the triggered animations and the general AI positioning. Everything feels pre determined and it’s completely unintuitive with being able to make decisions on the fly. Your players also don’t move in to space and hang offside a lot of the time. These floors are becoming painfully obviously in a next gen era where the likes of PES are so superior gameplay wise it’s not even funny.

As for game modes... FUT is what it is - the cash cow that keep EA Sports relevant. Without it they’d be nothing with the quality of the game they produce. I personally don’t play it, namely because I don’t fancy investing $100’s to just get a half decent team.

As for everything else... career mode is disappointingly stale now, despite them banging on about changes they’re pretty rudimentary and really don’t make much difference to the experience at all... Volta? Genuinely what is the point. It’s not fun, it’s not fifa street, so just can it. So what to say... you’d hope they pulled a half arsed effort out because they’re concentrating on the next gen version of the game. That’s the optimistic take, but I’m sure they’ll just keep churning out mediocrity until the end of days... so sad, this series used to be so cutting edge and enjoyable.",5,2020-10-12,Frandawg,False

Mafia III,PlayStation 4,481,481,"Mafia III is a game that proves how repetition can kill a potentially great video game. There was so much potential with its great setting and amazing characters. The story is good enough to keep me engaged. However, that’s about all the game truly has going for it. It gets repetitive, boring, and just feels like a chore after the prologue.
The 1960’s setting is done very well and is handled with great respect. The dedication to the time period is extremely refreshing. The characters are all unique and well voice acted. They all feel like they belong in the time period. But that’s where the positives end. The gameplay is mediocre with okay shooting mechanics. The driving feels weighty and accurate for the vehicles of that time period but ended up with me spinning out a lot.
What’s possibly the worst issue with the game is how boring it gets. The missions are all repetitive and follow the same formula: Go to a district, cause a certain amount of damage, deal with the local boss, repeat. I did this a total of 18 times and the only variations are the items I needed to damage/destroy.
In conclusion: the setting is great, but the missions are boring. If your interested in seeing an accurate depiction on the 1960’s then you might want to give it a try. If you’re looking for a fun gameplay experience then there are many other games to choose from.",2,2018-11-19,EdwardTomBoy,False

Metroid: Other M,Wii,238,238,"Concerns that the game destroys a strong female character and sets 'women in games' back should be immediately abandoned; demanding women fill either one of two roles in gaming is as sexist as any portrayal of the 'girly-girl' or 'homemaker'. The game shows a woman with inner turmoil and actual problems, yet still allows you to kick absolute arse through gameplay. A far more relatable and real feeling character than the cardboard cutout hero many games have (silent protagonists being much over done and a cheap replacement for characterization) or the typical 'Terminatrix' most people think female heroines should be in order to be cool. The style of play is fun with an intuitive switch between first person and third person (it's not clunky like lazy gamers would have you believe, and clearly they don't remember old games with actual clunky controls). In many ways, it plays like a classic metroid- a mostly platformer styled game with the return of your beam weapons and other powerups all combining (which can be good or bad depending on your taste admittedly) set between a variety of explorable zones. I high risk to rip the game out of the genre Prime had set when FPSes are a cash cow today. The new way of approaching enemies in the game and giving them unique ways of killing each one gives a much less boring feel of simply blasting your way through as with previous titles (a system that oddly no one had a problem with when used in God of War yet is just as viscerally satisfying here) and again can show- through Rule of Cool, check it on TV Tropes- just how much arse Samus can kick; while showing that she is still very much a person, a woman, with real problems and an actual personality rather then a face-frozen-in-scowl or some witty-kid focusing more on asinine commentary. Your main problems with the game will come from the somewhat awkward way most upgrades are given to you, which may cause a raised eyebrow at one point in the game, and leaves too much room for people to read too much into it (it's not that bad, but invited all the children into the house) and the fact that Nintendo is putting characterization much too late into the game, which will (of course!) upset those with preconceived notions on how they feel Samus should act, especially as the amount of talking she does is incredible (even if mostly inner monologue) compared to previous games, which can give a confused notion of seeming 'preachy'. These two are largely subjective problems; leaving the only real technical fallacy to the game being the rather difficult 'detective' moments, when you're required to find incredibly tiny bits of 'evidence', and often are hard to get your WiiMote to recognize your pointing at it, in order to advance. These are, thankfully, sparse through the game. It's short, like most old Metroids, and the re-playability isn't as grand as it could have been. I can suggest that one at least RENT this game, ignoring what others say about it, and try it yourself; form your own opinion. I PERSONALLY don't regret my money being spent on it, and I bought it- you should at least rent it, and form your own opinions. It's short, and the gameplay alone is interesting enough that there's no way you could really have wasted five bucks just to try it.

BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode Two,PC,89,89,"There are a lot of good things about this DLC, but overall I believe it was a bad idea to do DLC like this.

Good things about this dlc include the voice acting as always, the writing is sometimes cliche as it tries too hard to be philosophical. The gameplay is alright but really easy. This DLC will take you about 5 hours if you take your time to look at things and find audio logs, but in reality it is probably shorter than the first episode.

The problem with this episode is that in a worthwhile effort to tie everything together there is a lot of dialogue and cinematic cutscenes without gameplay. So this DLC is essentially a fairly easy stealth game played during a short movie.

So yes, the DLC is good regardless. The story is interesting and I have never felt so uncomfortable during one of the cutscenes, which I will not spoil. I'm legitimately impressed with the DLC for that alone. Truly a suspenseful and genuinely tense experience there.

As good as the DLC is though, it's a bad way to use DLC. Using DLC to flesh out a games story is like saying, ""If people want to understand the whole thing they'll have to pay us 70-80$."" I don't respect this decision at all as a consumer, but from a business standpoint I'll admit it's brilliant. People are going to feel like they missed out on something if they don't get the DLC for this game. I imagine nearly every person with this game will have the DLC because they'll feel like their experience is incomplete without it.

So it's good. This was a good place to stop the series, and I hope nobody ever touches the franchise again. Would I have been happier if the other 2 dlc were more gameplay focused like clash in the clouds? Yes. It wouldn't have been a **** you"" to everyone who bought the base game expecting to get the whole story.

Now, when we do that, the game is rated 31/10(at the time of this review, the rating was 3.1; it might get higher or lower as time passes), so what else can you say about it?

Graphics: Typical **** fare.  It's the same environments you've seen in Wildlands, Watch Dogs, and Assassin's Creed games.  Recycled assets.

Gameplay: It's OK for the first 3 hours, and 3 hours is when you realize there's no depth to it.

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm,PC,228,228,"Blizzard did a good job revamping the entire old Azeroth but Cataclysm isn't fun at all, to be honest, it is quite FRUSTRATING.

Heroics are much harder, which is fine because that's what Heroic means, but it gives those casual players that queue in the Looking for Group system a terrible experience since they will probably not be able to finish one single Heroic dungeon with Pick up Groups.

The worst thing, however, is the new profession Archaeology. It's all about random number generation, yes, pure luck. Things that relies on insane random numbers will create a terrible injustice situation: A very small amount of players will be getting rare items by doing just a couple of ""solves"" (this is how you create an item via Archaeology) while a huge amount of players will be trying to get the same exact item by doing the same thing over weeks and yet they might never get the item. There is no sense by doing this since Archaeology is certainly the worst professions, it is time spending and not fun at all.

It is quite impressive that Blizzard's staff is composed by the greatest game developers around the world that have enough time to develop games and their mistake on this last expansion was just insane as others failed grinding MMORPGs out there.

Medal of Honor: Warfighter,Xbox 360,156,156,"Let me start by saying that I am not going to waste my time with the single player.  The xbox 360 version has the multiplayer client as the first disc, enough said.  Now let's talk about the weaknesses.  The graphics are definitely not top-notch, but there are some decent visuals because the lighting and shadow effects are pretty decent.  The trade-off to sacrificing some visual fidelity is the fact that you have a solid framerate which yields a more consistent experience if implemented well enough in the netcode, which Danger Close does.  The map designs feel pretty solid with a decent amount of cover, but no overwhelming camp-sites.  I often find myself in firefight that lasts more than a quarter of a second with opponents using cover to decent effect.  Is this a CoD killer, no - CoD is a CoD killer.  Honestly, what more do you expect from a multiplayer-centric game than equitable experiences which this game provides in spades.  Don't believe me, just read the reviews - they all trash the single player and say the multiplayer is solid but not presenting anything new.  I would agree with that statement except to add that I find all of the features implemented to a greater effect than in any other multiplayer shooter to date.  It is not a genre redefining game, it is a solid multiplayer experience, one that is very welcome to this veteran of the genre.  While the menu interface is awkwardly designed in favor of a pc control scheme it is not 'broken' as some would have you believe.  Lastly, EA brings us another dedicated server, with a filter enabled browser for the win!  That is yet another reason this game has garnered so much of my support.  Let's start asking some of these other companies, hey, why can't you do that,  and support those that do.

Far Cry 3,Xbox 360,339,339,"Full play-through review. The story in Far Cry 3 is epic and one of its bright spots. Most shooters have a lame to semi lame story that feel like they are there just to connect one level to another, but with FC3 the story drives the action forward. I don't want to give anything away, but at the end of the game you have a hard choice to make, and the reason the choice is hard is because you have become attached to the characters and the different sides... this is testament to the great voice acting and spot on animations. I actually cared what happened. Graphically the game is beautiful and adds to the immersion. The combat is a lot of fun... personally I like the sniping and stealth aspect which works very well. I was worried about the predators like the leopards. I wondered if they would pounce out of every other bush. I am happy to report that run-ins happen, but the encounters are random and do not happen all that often. The autonomous A.I. makes for some interesting and random action. For example, one fight I was trying to move into position to knife kill a target when some friendlies in a boat caught the attention of my prey, thus giving me the distraction to go in for the kill. My main gripe with FC3 is in the middle of the game, before you are allowed to go to the second island, you have to do a series of main missions that are a grind at best and really annoying at worst. One mission has you doing a kill free corridor stealth run, another starts you out with only a knife and a set area that you are confined to, while another has you defending a position while a friendly AI does a repair... and failing the mission five times because he keeps getting shot from multiple angles. These quests were stripped of the very thing that makes the Far Cry series so great... choice. Also some of the real time events were just frustrating... and if you do not hit the right button at the right time you have to start over and do it again. But despite some major mid game annoyances and a couple of the more challenging real time events, the rest of the game is amazing... albeit a bit busy. I did not do the hunting, racing, collecting items (unless I ran across them) I stayed to the main and side stories and the outposts, assassinations and towers.",8,2012-12-08,ISSGOD,False
Metro Exodus,Xbox One,171,171,"Maybe I'm not the right person to be reviewing this game  I played the previous 2 metro titles and thought they were mediocre at best, but decided to give Exodus a chance and can honestly say in my personal opinion it is a pure dumpster fire ****.

So why do I hate this game so much?  I love first person shooters, I love survival horror, I love open world exploration but yet I hated this game with unbridled passion.   I am not a troll and do not trash things just for the sake of trashing them but I have to be honest.

Let's start by saying the game looks great and that's pretty much the only positive thing I have to say.

From the title screen it takes me no less than an average of 7 minutes staring at a loading screen to get into the game, this is unacceptable and frankly insulting.  The main character movements are sluggish and slow, ya know in other similar games when your character is carrying too much equipment and is sluggish?  Well this game you feel like that all the time.  The game also pretty much forces you down a linear path despite having open world **** to be honest I didn't wanna explore because it takes your character so long to walk **** row by boat.

The game also feels like it starts you out in another games hardcore mode where you have to pillage for scraps and get killed by a few shots which is fine if you choose to play that way but I prefer a more casual experience for my first time and if I choose a second playthru then I can choose that style.

Anyway I don't really know what else to say I just had a lousy time with this game, I tried to like I really did but uninstalled it after the 2nd mission.",3,2020-02-22,Rockst8r,False

In this case it generates up to four copies of yourself and swaps each other of the original and the copies. It has a creepy atmosphere like Portal series. The puzzle is very intriguing and keeps you playing to the end. As the background of the game, there are some science fiction-like motives about meanings of 'mind and body' and the morality of usage of such devices, which is interesting on its own. Overall I found it to be something like a 2D version of Portal 2 (which is a 3D game). I finished the game in about 10hrs. Therefore it is a bit short.

Grand Theft Auto V,PlayStation 3,824,500,"Its definitely a game that should not be missed but by the end I felt my expectations were once again too high for the GTA series or that the game itself just started falling flat.

I had a level of excitement I rarely have in games from the first mission to the last mission.  However, when I finally finished the final mission I just expected...I don't know...more.   It's really hard to expect more from a game that gives you so much but the game felt like a jack of all trades, master of none.  everything from gun play, driving, flying, and sports all felt solid but none of them felt great.  None of them felt like something that would be easy to learn and hard to master.  Its like everything was fun to do but I always wanted a little more.

My main gripe with the game was I felt like there was too much hand holding.  The game was easy and rarely did I fail any missions.  I suppose turning off the gun locking system could somewhat alleviate that but that't not how I want the game to be harder.  I wish the game let me figure out how to do my own heists.  Maybe walk me through the steps needed to plan it or to let me just try to go in guns blazing without a plan.  Every step of the way you're just walked through how to do everything you need to.  It wasn't that the heists weren't fun because they were. but like a lot of other fun games, they leave dreaming about how it could have been done better.

My second gripe is that the city is huge and the story doesn't really let us get to know it like I had hoped we would.  I hoped that more places would become familiar to me around the map.  The map is so full and detailed that as the major character in the game, I wanted to really get to know it better.  I do like the fact that the game doesn't force you to do much and lets you experience certain aspects of the game if you want to, but sometimes you really have to go out and look for things to do by yourself.

My third and final major gripe is the story or more the end of the story.  The story is fairly well written and the scripts were great and entertaining the whole time but things start to feel a bit rushed by the end and one of the final mission options is surprisingly anticlimactic.  The other two options make absolutely no sense to the story line or the characters and frankly make a certain characters development pretty irrelevant by the end.

I only wanted to share my gripes in this review because there is just too much to go over for all of my likes,  Despite my gripes, this is a great game and I had a lot of fun playing through it.  The music, the characters, the writing, the gameplay, the world, and just about everything else is just solid.  I had no issues with bugs(although I did seem to lose a few cars that I thought would go to the impound lot) and the framerate was smooth.  For some of the truly great games out there, by the end you want more but at the same time you feel complete.  With GTA V I wanted more and more but I didn't feel complete.

Who knows what DLC will bring to the game and I honestly hope R* plans to support this game with a lot of single and multiplayer content.  Obviously GTA online isn't out yet so this review is focused only on my initial single player experience and I'm still anxiously waiting to trying it out.

Its a fun game and the sheer scale will make your jaw hit the floor.  It looks and plays great but either my expectations were too high(likely) or the game actually could have been a little better in a few regards(also likely).  Either way, it's definitely worth checking out.",9,2013-09-27,Vicious0n3,False

Mighty No. 9,PlayStation 4,109,109,"Normally challenge is welcome but this game's reward returns are so minimal it's not worth it.

I remember Megaman X fondly, you had plenty of abilities even from the beginning, wall slides, wall jumps (from any flat surface), power shots, none of that is in this game but at least you get a dash and ledge grabs.  You get variations of that and your shots but they're virtually useless and add little to the enjoyment of navigating a level.

Level design seems inconsistent, most sidescrollers hazards have a prompt some of MN9's seem
instantaneous or punish you before you have a chance to learn (or worse, punish you while or after they reward you).  Megaman games usually have enemies who drop health or weapon energy, this seems to be replaced with a system that stores energy from enemies you ""dash"" through, to access this you have to pause/stop the action.  it ruins the flow of action.  weapons are uninspired.  I-frames are something meant to act as a grievance and learning tool for players, there's none of that if not minimal.  Other parts of levels rely on poorly explained mechanics and force you to play a specific way because if you don't, you'll lose health or your life.

Has-Been Heroes,Nintendo Switch,57,57,"I read the reviews before trying this game and even though the critics gave it a 5/10 I trusted the public and bought it anyway. Definitely a good decision.

Do not buy Has-Been Heroes if you're looking for a good story, stunning graphics or amazing music. However, if you're looking for a fun, rouge-like and very strategic game you're in the right place.

The critics complain that the game is too random and while the random part is true I have to disagree with them about it ruining the game. I've played through the game 6 times and completed it 3 out of those times. My first two deaths were me being a beginner and not understanding the game and the last death was by my mistake at the last boss fight. I definitely could 've won that run if I had played better.

What I'm trying to say is that even though you may not be able to win every run even while playing perfectly you can definitely win most runs if you get good at the game. And isn't dying a part of rouge like games anyway?

Has-Been Heroes has so far been fun for me but I feel like it might get a bit grindy after maybe 15-20 hours of play. Other than that it's a good well made game with a unique combat system that is very strategic. You will be spending most of your time in combat so I would recommend looking at some game play to see if you like it or not.

To the critics complaining about the difficulty I only have one thing to say.

NBA 2K14,PC,50,50,"Horrible horrible horrible game, built for frustration and not much fun to be had.  The controls are abysmal, they are on the level of the worst play controls for any game I've ever played.  Trying to control your players is like trying to control someone with a 2 second reaction time on the slickest of ice.  Nothing makes intuitive sense in this game AT ALL.  From the times you will press the pass button and instead of passing to the most obvious wide open player in front of you, it throws it across the court to a guy in double coverage, to the times when your guy is tripping over his own feet for 3+ seconds while you are unable to pass it to the painfully wide open guy - this game is just awful.

Running a play from the play book is comical, good luck trying to execute any of that in a timely fashion.  The game doesn't even feel finished - and it's like the 10th incarnation of this trash so there's absolutely zero excuse.

The MyCareer mode is a complete joke.  Playing offense is atrocious enough with your completely gimped player, but defense is just beyond believable.  How do people put up with this ****  I guess I forget the demographic that typically gets sold on this game hasn't necessarily seen a good game before to know how comparitively awful of an experience this game provides compared to even the most mediocre of games out there.  I played perfect defense (which is hard enough to do in a game that provides no good way to defend a ball handler) and was up in a guys face the whole time, all the way until the point where I'm directly on him and jumping up to block his shot, perfectly right in front of his face.  Shot **** violation.  Do I get ""team points"" for forcing the violation?  Nah.  But what do I see as the screen refreshes and the ball is being inbounded?  Yep - I lost team points for ""Bad shot block attempt""  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??

Mario Kart 8,Wii U,479,479,"Nintendo strikes gold again with Mario Kart 8, making me roll back into the groove of the Mario Kart Franchise. In terms of hour-counts, I've put around 500+ on MKDS, 70 on MKWii, and 90 on MK7, and MK8 is quickly rolling to the 20 hour mark. I've felt that this game's just got so much polish everywhere. The gameplay itself in races is perfectly solid, and the item use is almost perfectly balanced. The coins are great, new items are alright, and the music is definitely pretty good. I have a small gripe on the battle mode, and am a bit disappointed that it hasn't returned to infinite-time battles seen in Mario Kart DS. It isn't too big of a problem though, and the positives instantly outweigh the negatives. The online components are okay, but really good in terms of Nintendo's online systems. I feel that Mario Kart 8 does a good job with everything, and the DLC is just worth the money with all that good stuff. The game isn't exactly that long, but the replay value is pretty good. Also, I am somewhat disappointed with the lack of variety for the character roster we have for this game. Baby counterparts for many characters, 7 whole slots (instead of repaints) for the koopa kids is somewhat of a waste (I believe), and other random counterparts like tanooki mario are a bit unnecessary. I would have liked to see the return of some characters, including Dry Bones, King Boo, or maybe some new characters like the Goomba. Either way, the game is solid - definitely worth all your money

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered,PC,58,58,"ENG
How cool it must have been the people who in 2005 saw the game Intro that immediately makes clear what kind of an atmosphere to take the game, what emotions will be presented to the player. For me, the first half of the game was under the impression, unless you consider QTE, it's disgusting and a lot of it. I'm sure many liked detective Karla, which was nice to play, observe her methods of investigation and disclosure nature. The game has a scale of mental activity and that we find out what aspect and how much influence the character, what he loves, and he can't stand them. But the second half of the game, where the fate of Tyler and we are given a choice: leave his sweetheart in the hours when the city is not clear what is happening and everyone on the account, or to stay until the end and fulfill their civic (operating) debt, given that he is aware of what is happening and can help to prevent it. But the developers decided otherwise and just drained it. It is unclear what he even needed. But Karl also decided to do without a brain which is recognized in love after a couple of days, and even sex with a living corpse, at this point, I just dropped off, it was disgusting, though, not a bad erotic scene. This is my main complaint to the game, which would be included in my top favorite games, if not for these aspects, a lot don't need QTE, fail the characters, the battle with the Oracle, who was mighty in words, but it was the usual six.

Как же круто наверно было тем людям которые  в 2005 увидели эту игру, вступление, которое сразу дает понять в какой атмосфере будет проходить игра, какие эмоции будут подарены игроку. Для меня первая половина игры прошла под впечатлением, если не учитывать QTE, оно мерзкое и его много. Наверняка многим понравилась детектив  Karla, за которую было приятно играть, наблюдать ее методы расследования и раскрытия характера. В игре присутствует шкала психической активности и их этого мы узнаем, какой аспект и на сколько влияет на персонажа, что любит, а что просто не переносит. Но вот вторая половина игры, где решается судьба Тайлера и нам дают выбор: уехать со своей возлюбленной в час когда в городе не понятно что творится и каждый на счету, или остаться до конца и выполнить свой гражданский (рабочий) долг, учитывая, что он осведомлен что происходит и может помочь это предотвратить. Но разработчики решили иначе и просто его слили. Непонятно для чего он вообще был нужен. Но и Карлу тоже решили сделать без мозговой которая признается в любви спустя пару дней, да еще и совокупляется с живым трупом, на этом моменте я просто ""выпал"", это было омерзительно, хоть не плохая эротическая сцена. Это основные мои претензии к игре, которая бы вошла в топ моих любимых игр, если бы не эти аспекты, куча не нужного QTE, провал по персонажам, сражение с Оракулом, который был могущественным на словах, а оказался обычной шестеркой.",7,2017-11-22,Mobile,False

The Last of Us,PlayStation 3,2857,500,"I'll start of by saying that the game is fantastic, it really is. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it's my favourite single player game so far. Multiplayer, not so much. The story is extremely well written, well executed and incredibly engaging. From the get go you feel emotionally intertwined with the characters, you feel what they feel. No other game has taken me through so many emotions, whether that's scared, happy, saddened, excited or just  my pants.
The last Of Us delivers breathtaking scenery. The world is beautifully crafted, with an immense amount of depth. Back stories, visible events (as in, blood trails left on the floor from a fight) and decay are everywhere. The representation of a post apocalyptic world is second to non. The world is greatly explorable, giving a feeling of a non-linear path even though it actually is. You have optional mini side quests for loot and goodies (which I would highly recommend doing!)
The game is scary, no doubt; however, it doesn't let that over-ride the story. There is a great balance of horror and non horror story driven elements. The enemies are menacing and deadly, and in great supply, but the game does allow for breather periods where you can freely explore and truly take in the gorgeous scenery.
I can honestly say that in all my years of gaming, nothing has quite touched me like this. I may of only spent 12 hours playing, but them 12 hours where fantastic from start to finish. Nothing about this game, in my eyes is negative (apart from fishy AI at times). If you were considering picking this game up, I would suggest that if you like a challenge, with horror elements and a brilliant story, you should snap at this game and enjoy it. After all, if you pay for it, you deserve what you get.",10,2013-06-17,imfromimgur,False

Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3,PlayStation 3,59,59,"I actually followed news about the game from about 2 weeks before launch and was really disappointed about all the stuff that was leaked but as a die hard Naruto fan i still couldn't resist giving this game at least a chance and what can I say? It's totally worth it! Game was released on Friday over here and i actually did nothing but playing the game all weekend long and I definitely didn't have that much fun in a good while! the story mode is really awesome if your a bit into the story, it's basicly a 8 hour movie through the last few chapters of the series with a few battles which sometimes could be a little more difficult but overall I'm fine with it, If u didn't enjoy the story too much u still got Post-Game and in the Post-Game u got another 12 hours or missions to accomplish, some are quite equal to ninja storm 2, some are new and overall it's nothing brand new but if u liked that kinda stuff in 2 why wouldn't you like it in 3 as well? even tournaments and survival from generations make a comeback although survival must be opened through a mission in the story mode and they actually balanced it way more then it was in generations (where the latter survivals were almost impossible without cheating).

all in all i would say it takes about 25 hours to play through pretty much everything in the game (which i did) and after that there's still the online battle which is quite a let down as usual thanks to the crappy Spammkid community but i guess that's not Namcos fault. but if you actually got a few mates who got the game as well your in for a lot of good time which the game as i do  the new roster actually isn't as bad as everybody is complaining about, ofc quite some stuff was copy-pasted and the PTS chars really don't fit in the game while others should be in (edo kages    but overall especially the new awakening system makes a LOT of chars way more fun to play now! if u you think about it how it was in the former games: about 20 chars were interesting, rest was crap anyway and nobody played them like ever and  i would be actually more annoyed if they would have simply built 30 more chars which are pretty much all Copys of each other with minor tweeks and boring UJs then making a few good ones and making older chars more interesting and fun to play....i actually really never felt like playing chars like e.g. Hinata ever but now she became quite decent and it feels like a brand new char simply because i never played her in the former games 0.o

and on top of it all was a really awesome and well made Artbook which alone is probably worth about 10-20 euros. ofc the game isn't perfect and it isn't for everyone, it's really easy, online it's still unbalanced as hell, a lot of balance issues were copied over from generations and there certainly are some chars who wont be that interesting to play but i personally don't care. i had 25 great hours with the game so far in the story and i know that i will have 100 more with my friends online and i guess 60 euros for that is quite fair. if you're a Naruto fan and like Beat 'em up action games you can't do wrong with this game and even the ending isn't as bad as everybody says, it simply closes the story of the game where the manga continues and I actually like to have a real ending after a long story mode instead of an open end which forces me to buy the next game (which i will do probably anyway but still :-P  I hope this review helps a few people to decide whether they buy the game or not and I'm sorry for my bad English ",9,2013-03-11,Cha0zb0rn,False
PlanetSide 2,PC,548,500,"Before i start i would like to point out that this game is FREE, to those of you giving a FREE game of this quality a zero your quite frankly completely wrong. Unlike many free games Planetside 2 is not a pay to win although you can pay to unlock weapons they can all be unlocked without paying a penny, only skins require real money to obtain.

The game is by no means perfect there's a steep learning curve that can be a pain to get passed and getting dropped into the action when its on such a huge scale can be disorientating and frustrating to new players. The weapons unlock quite slowly and there is no real end game no faction can actually lose.

Now with that out the way Planetside 2 is possibly the most epic experience you can have on any game, thousands of people fighting epic battles with aircraft tanks and infantry is just amazing to be apart of. Especially with some friends or a decent squad or outfit where you work as a team to capture of defend strongholds. This game far surfaces other FPS games like Halo and COD in my opinion and does so on a scale that's beyond belief and all this from a free game.

Disco Elysium: The Final Cut,PC,240,240,"Disco Elysium is a game that exceeded my expectations and was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

Every decision you make, every interaction with other characters influences the development of the plot and your main character. There is no room for randomness - every choice you make has consequences that can be disastrous or favorable for your character.Disco Elysium's graphics and art style also deserve a special mention. The game's fully hand-drawn universe is full of detail and creates a unique mood-setting world that illustrates endless city life and crime.However, Disco Elysium's gold cup is its exceptionally deep, well-crafted and literary script, which is one of the main reasons why I rate this game a 10 out of 10. The dialogs are constructed in a way that allows you to feel every emotion, every nuance and every character is designed with incredible care. An explosive cocktail of drama, comedy, dark humor and philosophical thoughts opens up in front of **** in all, Disco Elysium is a masterfully crafted work of art that left me with a deep impression and understanding.

Empire: Total War,PC,158,158,"I understand how extreme it is to give a game a 0 or 10 but in this case, I honestly feel it deserves it. A game that provided me with over 1200 hours of gameplay (and still counting) for me, ranks right up there with such legendary games as Master of Orion 2, Sid's Civilization and XCom.

When the game was first released there were plenty of bugs but the patches long ago have squashed them all for me. Never before has a game pushed the boundaries so much and seemed so grand in scale, I was in strategy heaven! Introducing interactive naval combat for the first time in the Total War series, 3 different theaters, a technology tree, a completely new era, and the list goes on. To me, Empire Total War is the time when Creative Assembly really dug down in their creative spirits, took risks by breaking away from the safety of their melee heavy games (which are great by the way) and delivered a unique experience that every strategy gamer should experience.

If you like strategy games, this is a must have for your collection in my honest opinion.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution,PC,796,500,"The good: I enjoyed the plot, side quests, hacking minigame (initially), and don't regret playing it as a whole,but there is some flaws.

The bad:
Graphics
..are just ok, it's repetitive and with a lack of detail, optimized for a slow console perhaps? Noticed no difference with Dx11.

Game play
.. is somehow too easy, even when playing on hardest, as covers = imba, and guards, even after you throw a grenade their way, will assume it's nothing when the 30 seconds hard timer is up, and besides, hardly even bother come search after you when you're noticed even. (Prefer stealth mechanics as in Metro 2033).
The 3rd person cinematic for takedowns and fall implant breaks up the flow and becomes irritating, the cover mode/look however, is cool. The different approaches, so much spoken of, feels like a repetition over and over, with air ducts, hackable door locks or brute force. The ugly*:
Finally, the end credits, it feels like I'm visiting some distant relatives which is having a slideshow of people I care nothing about. To be harsh, it breaks the immersion I had in the game, and becomes everything but a reward for finishing.

Uncharted: Drake's Fortune,PlayStation 3,658,500,"At Least it looked nice.

All I can say is I am glad I played Uncharted 2 First, and Uncharted 3 came out before I got around to this.
Firstly, the cover is inadequate, especially against the pirates that have crack shots and can throw like baseball legends, or my favourite the shotgun wielding pirates who appear all ninja like and one shot you.
The Cover issue would be fine if it wasn't so damn hard to kill these unarmoured pirates, I've had a few survive shots to the head, Keep in mind I was playing normal, and I was taking less damage then the most basic enemy's with a slow heal time and cover that usually doesn't cover you, I found myself dying alot. I also noticed I ran out of ammo while trying to kill the current wave of baddies before moving up, taking time for head-shots generally becoming unfavourable do to there incredible aim and drakes lack of health.
Also there is no mild zoom like in Uncharted 2, what you get is all you get to work with.  I also must make mention of the poor directions, often leaving grenade launchers to kill turrets in locations you fail to notice while taking heavy fire, or like in the Jet ski chapter where it fails to mention you control Elena and her grenade launcher (she just magically acquired) A scene with alot of potential for high octane fun, that boils down to a crawl with you just blasting the hell out of everything with your (her) grenade launcher, instead of flying through with some epic cinematic style jumps or something. and Lastly before concluding the rant, Drake's slow ass doesn't get a sprint, or a combat sprint, just a sketchy roll to cover, and for some reason the shotgun that the enemy's so often one shot you with, fails to one shot them more often then not.(Unless your really close of course)

Monster Hunter: World,PC,229,229,"Monster Hunter: World is my first real foray into the franchise after poking at demos for the older 3DS games prior. I'm sure I'm not the only one with that background, but I can say that World on the whole feels like an attempt to get more people into the series.

MHW's premise is rather thin for a game of its scale. This is not in of itself a bad thing, but as a lore-hound I might have appreciated a little more fluff.

Mechanically speaking however the game is significantly more complex, with more keyboard binds, at least as far as I can remember, then any game I have played in the past 15 years, with the possible exception of Sins of a Solar Empire: a 4X space strategy game. That MHW is an action game with this many binds is impressive, if at times kind of annoying. I would also regard it as strangely akin to Axiom Verge in that having tried both mouse and keyboard versus controller, neither is 100% comfortable for me to use and I find myself wishing I had an extra hand, or at least a few more neurons.

You may wish the same when attempting to ascertain the breadth of content in MHW: There are fourteen different types of weapons to use, some melee, some ranged, some simple and others tactically complex, multiple environments to hunt in, a few dozen monster types with varying strengths and weaknesses and tables of dropped crafting materials, many, many items to pick up, craft, an arm-mounted ""slinger"" that can fire various types of found ammo and use and at least two different sets of armor and one of each weapon type to make for each monster, with the Iceborne expansion adding an entirely new ""grapple claw"" mechanic, more moves for the weapons and of course, a lot more monsters and gear to craft. In the vein of many Japanese games I have played in the past: The EDF series, Sengoku Basara, Navel Ops, and others: There is a staggering amount of stuff to do, find and make. MHW is, in a word, dense. If nothing else, you will get your money's worth in hours played by far, if the game is your bag. When hunting alone or with one other player, and I do recommend at least one other player, you have the option of being accompanied by a helpful cat-like creature called a Palico, who can use a selection of unique support items, gather materials, distract the monster for you, and generally be nice to have around. When playing with three or four players however, the Palicos stay behind to enforce the 4-player party size limit.

And now the meat of it: The combat in MHW is certainly more accessible then earlier iterations of the franchise, but gameplay overall is notably clunkier and rigid when compared to contemporary titles, especially western ones. It took some hours for me to adjust to the various oddities of the game's design and hurdles of progression, not the least of which is your extremely limited defense and damage at the game's outset- you will regularly die in early quests and any quest thereafter you are not properly geared for, as player skill will not save you from getting one shot by a powerful attack, thus wasting one of your team's precious limited respawns per assigned quest, costing you time, money and patience. Gear levels aside, as I mentioned earlier I've never been able to reach a real level of comfort with any control setup for MHW. Mouse and keyboard simply has too many separate binds to be usable within a reasonable frame of response time, not helped by a complete remap of the default binds accompanying the infamously delayed-for-pc Iceborne expansion, and locking character movement to eight cardinal directions versus the more nuanced directional control of an analog stick. Controller makes character movement and certain melee attacks and other inputs easier to perform, but hopelessly complicates aiming any projectile weapon or the grapple claw. And both control setups must contend with what I felt, at least initially, was a labyrinthine, archaic menu system and curiously unresponsive quick-use wheel. Aside from any of this, there is also the issue of the disparity in design quality between armors for the two available genders. Whatever your personal feelings on skimpy armor designs for female characters, there is simply a marked lack of quality and design creativity for the female armors.

All that being said, MHW is nonetheless fun, perhaps inexplicably so at times. It's loud and colorful, with easily understandable icons, recognizable outlines for monsters, weapons and armors, reasonable load times, and it's very easy for friends to link up and do hunts together. Combat can be satisfying when all factors line up sufficiently, especially the mounting mechanic and grapple claw techniques. The map and guidance system is fairly robust.

Above all, a bulk of my online friends have the game, and it is always in my experience better to play games of this nature with friends. Whatever its flaws, and there are many, MHW manages to be an entertaining and addicting experience.",7,2020-01-13,Captain_Chaos,False

A Plague Tale: Innocence,PC,442,442,"The majority of the game is a linear stealth challenge with light puzzle mechanics.  Both literally light, and figuratively, most of the puzzles involve manipulating light sources. None of the puzzles are particularly challenging, and there's not much of a sense of jeopardy as the light sources permanently stave off the danger.  However, occasionally, the game rises to a frenetic pace and that's when it's really in its element as you have to respond quickly to stay safe.

Combat is best avoided until some late game items/skills are achieved and the boss fights are pretty lacklustre generally.  When you do have cause to fight, you typically are trying to achieve one solid whack to the head with the slingshot, however, there are number of ways to achieve that.

For the most part you have an AI companion following you around, the game didn't really capitalise on all it could with that.  They are part of the world, if they get into trouble you have to save them, if you leave them alone too long they make noise.  However, there were very few opportunities for either of those things to happen.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,PC,1575,500,"One of the best RPG's I have ever played. The games combat does take some getting used to, in the early hours of the game you are faced with fairly large groups of enemies and the tutorial tips are not very helpful.

However once you get into the swing of things, it really starts to make sense. Personally i like the more difficult combat its refreshing. In a lot of games recently you can just run into a bunch of enemies and wave your sword around like crazy with little consequence.
This is not the case with The Witcher 2, to defeat packs of enemies you usually need to use everything in your arsenal, traps, signs, dodging, potions, oils etc...

This game is very re-playable as there are many choices throughout the game and often the consequences are not realised until later in the story. Most of the choices you make are not very ""black and white"" It is very engaging.

The story is pretty mature, I wouldn't recommend this game for a younger audience. Not only because of the sexual scenes in the game but also because the story is quite political.

The graphics are simply amazing, CDProject Red has done an amazing job crafting the locations. There are slight issues with graphical problems at the moment, for example the shadows on my game have some weird dithering effect but i expect it will be sorted out in patches.
Obviously these high graphics mean you will probably only be buying this game if you have a good graphics card, the game still pretty good on low settings however.

All in all, an amazing game with a combat system that requires some thought about the fight beforehand and crazy through the roof production values.

Child of Light,PC,107,107,"Find the Sense of Life

Advantages:
Truthful story, all right told, perfectly painted and just conveniently assembled in the single project!
Disadvantages:
No, not heard.

In the modern world is so little time for contemplation: few people can afford to stay and just listen to the silence, to look at yourself and your life's path traversed. To answer the question: why all this happened? ...
However, the silence itself finds us through the art of artists and musicians. Good video game, of course, can be considered a real art. After all, it is intended to bring the light of peace and joy, at the same time, it must be clear and accessible.

Honestly, I did not play the last five years. But the ""Child of Light"" - this is not the case: the music has brought me to this game. I was looking for some compositions in the social network, and suddenly stumbled upon the soundtrack of this unique game.
I was so carried away by the fabulous world of Lemuria that almost design my own art for this game.

Fortunately, many have already written a wide variety of game- play and reviews on the game world. But my heart can not be silent, seeing such beauty as the Child of Light. This music, these poetry, it is the Kingdom of Light ... Excuse me, but then I can not keep silent! Especially when there is a bright catharsis: with every victory in Lemuria the weather changes.

What I have ever learned from the Queen of Light? She gave me the meaning of life, as I was looking for it last two years of study at the university. Already I tried to find it with someone 's help. And I found it!
After the final scenes I was definitely clear why to live: I just put myself in the place of Aurora, and Lemuria in place of the world in which I am. ""I'm not afraid of the threat of sleep"" - as Aurora would told in my place. And I just somehow wilted ...
Courage, here's what you need to overcome your difficulties in life. It would seem that this conclusion is trivial. But as well as it's beautifully illustrated and you offered to play, with the courage to pass all tests in Lemuria and come out the winner. In the first place, the winner of your fears. And when you see a little girl turns out to be more courageous than you, you want to be at least as she is.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,PC,579,500,"Graphically slick from the outset this is game worth playing with good headphones as it's no slouch in the soundfx dept either, with sound actually being used greatly to identify threats and other changes in the environment.

Variety of choice, decision making and communication. These are the elements that make this game great. EG.
You can hear someone running in the room above, running carelessly down the corridor. You might place a breaching charge on the ceiling and explode your way into the room, or you could start shooting through the ceiling hoping you hit somthing, or you could drop a little drone and race up there to view through the onboard camera, marking anyone found for your team.

The environments are nearly completly destructable and can be used to shoot through, smash through,  detonate or re-enforce as you see fit. Every game plays out differently due to player choice of character and decisions made on the fly and in response to team mates or opposition..

Even playing with complete beginners can be fun due to thier hilarious and often clueless decision making, accidentally slipping off roofs, having to run away from their own badly thrown grenades and just plain panicking. My own personal worst was planting a C4 charge, then panicking in response to an enemy entering the room immediately detonating it, without moving away. Wrong trigger! Dead team mates can cycle through point of view for the live players making it even more embarassing if you're the last man on your team standing at the time.

Slowly as you come to understand the multitude of guns, armour, and gadgets available, you can begin to plan for each encounter more effectively. It's a game that really lends itself to team chat.

Divinity: Original Sin,PC,480,480,"From the second the game starts there is this feeling of adventure and wanderlust, something that we used to have in older RPGs, that weren't agenda driven social justice platforms, when people outside of gaming couldn't influence artists into doing this their way. When stories were genuine and experience were crafted with love and care.
This applies to much more than the writing, and Original Sin has some damn good writing, it's turn based gameplay is easy to get into, but offers a lot of intricacies and interactions to learn and exploit, while providing a challenge to players of all skill levels.
The environmental interactions and innovative co-op play put much bigger games to shame. Truly it's a wonder that a small European developer like Larian were able to make a game that dwarfs major productions from EA and the like. It just goes to show you, when you LOVE doing what you do, and don't just do it to turn a profit and support some stupid agenda, it will shine through in your work.

Original Sin is a must for any cRPG fan and considering it's modern look and easy to pick up nature, I am certain that it will bring a lot of newcomers to the genre.

My only gripe with it is that due to budget management or whatever, Larian weren't able to add NPC reactions to the day/night cycle and weather system, but it's such a small thing in such a massive, uniquely enjoyable game that it doesn't matter.

Elden Ring,PC,2406,500,"I am desperately looking for that masterpiece so many critics claimed to see in this game.

From a technical point of view, its a desaster.
Bad controls, laggy input, enemies stun locking you, microstutters all along.
Menu handling is atrocious, quick slot management is a bad joke.

There are so many items, that are hardly explained at all - You are up to trial and error and guesswork to figure out how things work.

Enemy difficulty is all over the top and while I know, thats part of a souls game, the enemies here are unfair.
You either play perfectly or you die. Period. Nothing much inbetween. You cant run, cause you run to slow.  When you are trying to mount you are likely to be hit during that. If you ever get smashed to the ground, you can reload already, you are not getting up again alive. Hits are often nor registering and you are driven by a constant momentum, that easily moves you out of an enemies hitbox, while the visuals show your swort going through the enemy just fine.
As the controls are so bad, playing perfect is pretty impossible to pull off, so the only thing remaining is frustration.

Visuals are nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Story... Well, what story? I have been playing for nearly 10 hours now and the only piece of story is ""You are a chosen, grab the ring, save the world"" presented in like 2 minutes? The story is pretty much on par with super mario from the NES times so far.

I have been runnning around, killing & dying a lot and looking for an actual sense in what i am doing.

Exploring feels interesting, but usually only rewards you with death. I have yet to find any usefull gear, well actually any gear I can use at all. Drops are scarce and so far not matching my class or just worse than what I had from the beginning on.

Overall, my gameplay experience is ""Kill and be killed, rinse and repeat"" -  because thats all there is to this game. Unfortunately i went way beyond the refund time to look for more in this so-called masterpiece, but as far as I can tell, there just isnt more to it.

Make a full game, charge us what it's worth. Release two editions; Regular and Collector. Collectors edition comes with the out of game goodies or in-game cosmetic items ONLY - NO PAY TO WIN IN GAME CRAP THAT AFFECTS GAMEPLAY! Later, when there is an expansion - Charge us what THAT is worth. No more ""season passes - It's a scam, and we're tired of it! Lootboxes are as scummy as season passes - Especially in a competitive multi-player FPS! RNG and lootboxes have no business in an FPS that is not a persistent MMO!

DICE - You made a beautiful game. We're sorry you were probably forced into creating these scummy monetization systems. We get that you guys have to make the game, and feed your families. The negative review I am giving does not reflect on you, in my opinion.

Metacritic - Deleting PC user reviews, and having only the absurd ""professional critic"" reviews show up as the main score **** needs to stop. These critics are on EA's payroll - It's completely obvious! I used to overlook the fact that you do this, but no more. Start showing the scores for both user and critic on the main menu/tile for a game when we search for it, instead of the critic review!

Monster Hunter: World,PlayStation 4,518,500,"So after spending a great majority of my three day weekend over indulging in Monster Hunter: World, here is my review.

This is by far the best Monster Hunter title yet.  But there are some new issues despite some great quality of life improvements.

Little things like being able to move and use items is a very welcome addition, but takes away some of the crucial decision making that was part of the fun.

Merging single player and multi player was a great idea but the execution is very flawed.  You can only see quests posted in your session (max of 16 players) and in order to find anything other than the one or two that show up you have to search for an SOS flare.  These quests are usually fine but I have dropped into a bunch of hunts where they are on their last continue only to fail the mission as soon as I get loaded in and make it to the fight.

With being able to harvest most resources just by walking by them and a quick press of the button, the scout flies are a great addition to help spot the now bountiful amount of harvesting points.  It's also incredibly fun to do the initial tracking of the monster with them.  But they've also aided in dumbing down some other elements of the series, as once you've found the monster they can always guide right whereit went.  So you no longer need to paint the monster to keep track of it once if flees.

Finally moving to the more powerful hardware and making the maps one giant local as opposed to 10 - 15 small rooms is amazing.  The areas feel fast and alive.

Overall, this is what the series needed albeit still with some fine tuning still. Pick this game up.  It will eat up all your time.",9,2018-01-30,PixelBard,False

+ Good and original story
+ Fun FPS action
+ Good multiplayer
+Awesome presentation

- Not exactly the best graphics
- Multiplayer is kind of dead.

It is true, multiplayer is sort of dead now, there are still some people playing, mainly high leveled players. Get some friends to join your game.

I have a tip everyone, don't choose ""All Modes"", choose ""Deathmatch"" or ""Team Deathmatch"", especially Deathmatch, because All Modes require more players to join in to start the match. Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch only require 4 people if you put in Small Game. It's much easier to begin a match and getting friends to join you.

Enslaved: Odyssey to the West,Xbox 360,100,100,"Wow...this game is amazing! I have played a ton of games this year, but I must say I have been blown away by how fantastic this game is. This game is extremely underrated. I'm really not sure why this game isn't more popular. Here is my small attempt to get the word out.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic United States that has been overrun by vicious mechs. You play as a character named Monkey with awesome climbing and fighting abilities. With the ""help"" of female companion Trip, you escape a slave ship together. The gameplay involves solving puzzles and fighting mechs with your female companion throughout the game. Trip reminds me a lot of Elika from 2008's Prince of Persia. She is very helpful throughout the game, and although the game is one long escort mission she never gets in the way. The gameplay reminds me most of 2008's Prince of Persia, except the weapons are very different. The climbing in the game reminds me of both Prince of Persia and Uncharted 2.

The graphics are awesome! The scenery and character models are both very well done. The game world is extremely colorful and beautiful. The sound is also incredible. I really love the epic soundtrack. The voice acting is extremely well done and made me really care about the characters. Perhaps one of the best aspects of the game is the story. For me it's a tossup between Mass Effect 2, Alan Wake, and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West for best video game story of the year.

Don't take this game for granted. You need to play Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, especially if you enjoyed Uncharted 2 or Prince of Persia 2008. Really can't express enough how enjoyable this game is. On ""Normal"" settings the game took me about 10.5 hours to complete.

And bonus there's fan service customization for your lightsaber, clothes, and more. I was nervous going in knowing EA's history and was afraid if they would 'Visceral Games' Respawn, but happy and relieved to say that EA with no strings attached fully supported Respawn to deliver one of Star Wars' strongest entries yet and a 2019 sleeper hit.

Warframe,PC,561,500,"No matter how fun or interesting Warframe looks to someone who hasn't played it yet after playing it for over 60 hours its really neither of those. The constant reusing of level layouts will become apparent after a few missions and the MMO style ''kill dozens upon dozens of the same faceless mobs  grinding will make the missions seems even more repetitive when you need about a days worth of grind plus the manufacturing time  which is minimum 12 hours and can get up to days depending on the item  on new weapons and warframes.
And imo the most important aspect of this game that should be highlighted is the fact that the developers are giving hints of making this game P2W. I will explain:
Warframes are basically the characters you play as each having very different stats and powers to make them unique. They can be bough from the cashshop or farmed from the different bosses in the game  which although takes a lot of time I am fine with  The interesting part comes in the fact that in the time of writing this review there are 3 warframes with the tag ''Prime''  basically very hard to make versions of existing warframes ).
One of them is a TIMED EXCLUSIVE BUY ONLY version of Excalibur. Looking at the free ones you would think that the only difference between a prime and non-prime would be looks and polarities  bonus stats for equibable items  and seeing as polarities have a free version way of getting them you would ask me what the problem was seeing as apparently the only thing a free user would lose is the looks of the Excalibur Prime. Unfortunately that is not true the Excalibur Prime has a higher shield regeneration than its counterpart something which the other 2 FARMABLE PRIMES don't have.
In conclusion I would recommend anyone thinking of trying this out to keep in mind the extreme repetitiveness of missions both in layout and objectives, the very long time required just to get new weapons and warframes and most importantly the fact that developer has shown signs of giving this game  which has PVP MODE  items that are buy only which are better than the free versions  making it P2W.",0,2013-10-22,Xarxan,False

Alan Wake,Xbox 360,213,213,"If I was allowed only one word to describe Alan Wake, ""atmospheric"" would always come to mind. If there is one thing that Alan Wake nails down perfectly, it is firmly placing the player within it's world, not letting go until the credits roll. With great use of fog, lighting, sound and art design, the game does an absolutely fantastic job realizing the world Remedy was trying to create, and it is a rather satisfying one at that. While the game more or less sells itself on story and atmosphere alone, the are some relatively minor gripes with design and gameplay that hold it back a bit. The game introduces an interesting light mechanic, requiring you to dispel, usually through means of a flashlight, the darkness that surrounds the bulk of enemies found in the game. It adds a little something to the game that changes the feel of combat when compared to your typical third-person shooter. There is also a nice dodge mechanic, giving you a chance to slip out of incoming attacks, considering you time things just right. Overall, the action and gunplay elements of the game work well, and while the game itself is pretty straight-forward, combat feels very satisfying. That said, while the gunplay was handled rather well, traversing the environment can sometimes feel a bit clunky. Things like jumping feels more than a little off. At it's worse, the small number of platforming sections in the game can be a bit of a headache. For the most part though, the time spent navigating Alan through the world with sometimes be greeted with some awkward looking jumping animations. Also, your spring can sometimes be halted when making contact with walls, which can add unnecessary tension to chase scenes. Overall, Alan Wake is a fantastic game. There are a few noticeable issues, but most are rather minor. If you are looking for an interesting story and great atmosphere, this game is for you. If you are looking for a good third-person shooter, and can deal with a few issues, this game is also for you.

Half-Life 2,PC,1228,500,"Half-Life 2... Often proclaimed one of the best, if not one of the greatest first person shooters, if not video games of all time. Released in 2004 to great fame and accolades, I was but then an 11 year old devotee of Sonic, Metroid, Zelda, and Star Wars. I hardly knew or cared. But as I grew older, and the internet became more prominent in my life, I  began to hear of this wonderful thing called Half-Life 2, starring this great hero, a nuclear physicist named Gordon Freeman, who battled against the evil Combine to save humanity from its position under the jackboots of a tyrannical alien regime. When I discovered TvTropes, I got exposed to many more references to this game. I was told of the epic journey of the great hero fighting all alone against the future straight out of Nineteen Eighty-Four. I read that I was supposed to be a critical piece whose actions and choices would decide the fates of billions. I read about leading the citizens in rebellion against their alien oppressors in a climatic battle in City Seventeen. I heard about the awesome Gravity Gun. I read about the fearsome striders. I read about turning the antlions on the invaders. I read about the horror of Ravenholm. I heard about great and memorable characters, an engaging story, and so many other things which sounded like heralds of greatness.
I first got my hands on a valve game, Left 4 Dead, in '08. And I loved it. I still do, just as I do Left 4 Dead 2. I got The Orange Box in 2010. I got it more or less for Portal. Portal, damn, that game is fantastic.  As you would expect, having consecutively played three superb games from Valve, I was very much looking forward to the next game in my sights: Half-Life 2. So I selected it from the main menu of The Orange Box on my Xbox360 and began a new campaign on the medium difficulty setting. I as already an FPS veteran at the time, having played through games like Metroid Prime 1 & 2, Bioshock, Metro 2033, Goldeneye 007, the Halo series, F.E.A.R., Doom, Doom 3, and Quake 4. With everything begun, I was prepared to be blown away. I was eager for the greatest FPS ever made.

It ****.

I personally rate games mainly on story, gameplay, and characters, with all of these being roughly equivalent. For me to approve ****, it has to do well enough in these three categories. However, I ultimately pass judgement based on whether or not the game was fun to me. I can forgive quite a lot of **** is an entertaining experience. Do I think Half-Life 2 is fun? NO! I think it's awful. I had to force myself to finish this game. It failed in story, gameplay, and characters. It wasn't even something that I could enjoy taking the piss out of.
I know, you're probably frothing with rage and confusion over why I think Half-Life 2 is an overrated piece of crap. I've heard the arguments from the fans, but I just don't see it like they do. I respect their opinions, but I disagree. Truth be told, I feel like this game was always very close to being the great experience I was told about. Of course, realistically, nothing could have lived up to the hype.  Even though I habitually make a note to deliberately not buy into hype, it was impossible to go in with anything other than great expectations. I could argue that it had to end in disappointment, but I disagree. I've played other great games, like Call of Duty 4, Bioshock, Far Cry 3, Metroid Prime 2, Metro: Last Light, and Portal, and felt that they deserved the praise they got. Perhaps not the extravagant fanboy praise, but plenty of praise and accolades nevertheless. Half-Life 2 got so many elements right and had a lot of good ideas, but the execution was so often feeble. If maybe just only a few elements were different, then perhaps I would be raving about how I love this game. And I think that, had I played it when it first came out, or at least within two years of its release rather than six, then I could very well have been much more favorably impressed. I could I personally actually quite like Half-Life 2: Episode 1, which was a much tighter game with a much more interesting and dynamic plotline where the player character actually seems to accomplish things.
The story is irritatingly impenetrable while being of only vague concern, and yet still managing to hang constantly over the player while constantly keeping them in the dark.
The gameplay is the worst part, given how it fails to make combat fun in a first person shooter while bloating the game to excessive length with vehicles and puzzles.
The characters are mostly forgettable with a few good exceptions. Gordon Freeman is the worst possible kind of protagonist for this game. Alex Vance should have been it.
The game is not fun except in small doses and in certain parts. Your experience may vary. I would recommend watching a walkthrough or LP rather than spend money on it.",1,2013-10-04,mortabunt,False

Divinity: Original Sin II,PC,466,466,"The Divinity Sin series is the best kickstarter games to date. DOS: 2 improves on the original with a better story, expanded skills, and fully voiced NPC's just about everywhere. The heart and hook of this game is the combat system though.

A new system is in place where your characters have both physical and magical armor. It serves as an important ""buffer"" before they start taking real damage to hit points. Even more important, armor blocks status effects and this game has a slew of nasty ones. Stunned, Cursed, Burning, Petrified, Diseased, Suffocating, Frozen, Crippled, to name just a few. Once your armor goes, things get ugly real fast. Enemies have both magic and physical armor as well, so here is where the strategy on your part comes into play. You can build a balanced party good for dealing with all enemies, or you can focus on doing one type of damage and have a cakewalk on some enemies, and a nightmare with others. Up to you.

The game has a good amount of dialogue solvable encounters. You work against a persuausion system where where an NPC has a base attitude stat toward you and then an attribute like intelligence or strength is used to reflect the type of answer you can give. To me some of the attributes didn't make a whole lot of sense. I can see intelligence, wits, and memory being used, but think Finesse and Constitution shouldn't really be able to help you answer questions.

The crafting system is there, but in a highly neutered state. There is no blacksmithing anymore, just the ability to craft food, potions, arrows, and grenades. Finding an epic recipe and going on a quest for the ingredients make for interesting quests so not sure why they did away with it. Perhaps they ran out of time to implement it.

Finally I wouldn't be giving an honest review if I didn't comment on the overuse of elements in this game. Sure they were meant to give another layer of strategy to combat, and sometime do, but nearly every skill can produce fire, electric, ice, poison, etc. I don't think level 1 skills in general should have been able to create fire fields and poison clouds. It also makes every battle graphically quite messy, hard to highlight an enemy sometime because they are often overlayed in smoke, poison, and fire.

There you have it. I give it a 9 despite my quibbles about the elements and crafting. With the fall of Bioware, we are really lucky to have Larian still producing high quality RPGs.",9,2017-10-13,Jeb077,False

I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews. Honestly, I can't. ACO is a marvelous game. The environment is astounding. I have had no bugs or framerate problems. The gameplay is smooth and slick. The combat has been refined and is fun and effective. The side missions are interesting and fun and far superior to just about anything else out there. Every side mission is different and unique. There are no fetch quest side quests. Some may start that way but turn into something else. The world is alive and immersive. The hunting to craft is handled well and a nice addition. The story so far (I'm at level 24) is compelling enough and I'm interested in what is going to develop. IMO no game is a 10 unless it is groundbreaking in a spectacular way and no game is a 0 unless it is a completely broken pile of poops. It's ridiculous to rate a game a 0 without good reason. ACO is a great game, it looks great, works great and will provide 100's of hours of fun. There is an enormous amount of things to do. I say Bravo!

Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns,PC,508,500,"As an avid Guild Wars 2 player, I had mixed feelings about the direction they company was taking HoT. Mostly I was concerned about the grind factor and the difficulty of the new zone. I started playing as a skeptic, but HoT has won me over.

The zone design is brilliant, the zones are beautiful and I finally feel like I have to fight my way through a war zone. I haven't felt like that since they nerfed Orr, another end game zone.

Admittedly there are plenty of things to work (grind for), but I'm having so much fun just playing I don't really notice it. I love the dynamic event chains at different outposts. I love the story. And I love the idea that if I'm not paying attention, I'm likely going to end up dead.

GoldenEye 007 (2010),Wii,85,85,"Visiting this game for the 1st time in 2023 in order to compare this 007 adventure to the previous-gen titles, my overall opinion is that the game barely functions with a Wii remote+Nun-chuck. Levels drag on way too long at times and the game can offer up some pretty unfair moments whenever the controller decides to go haywire or be unresponsive. Quick-time events will also occasionally pop up without a moment's notice which is irritating at best since the game will respawn you at the previous checkpoint, making you re-view cutscenes that you cannot skip 3 or 4 times over while you figure out exactly what the game wants from you. 
In comparison to the N64 GoldenEye 007, there is none. The 64 version by far blows this version out of the water both in story and in gameplay. The 2010 version made head-scratching cuts both to the story and the gameplay and it has confusing controls when played with the Wii Remote+Nunchuk. I have a feeling that the developers knew the game **** with your standard wii controller, since the game was originally sold with a handheld Wii controller, much like an XBox or GameCube controller, which I assume is how the game is played best.",5,2023-12-10,TheCoxLong,False

The Order: 1886,PlayStation 4,1120,500,"This game was an awesome masterpiece and It was very entertaining.
I have really enjoyed it. The whole day, I spend for the game was certainly no regrettable mistake.
The fantastic story combined with a good working fighting system and of course the fantastic graphic was inherently consistent. I was not disturbed by the vast amount of cutscenes because they were integrated very well in the course of the game and kept the tension high. When it was come to the playable parts you either had quicktime events, climbing or shooting sections. Despite of the enormous weapon repertory, the enemy's were not so easy at all. Some of them were **** badasses and I am not talking about the werewolves. I have died many times. The climbing sections remind me of AC but this is only a minor matter. In fact, for the playable parts there was a good mix of everything and I was not bored like so often, when you play a game which repeat itself at some points again and again and again. I have liked it.

Tekken Tag Tournament 2,PlayStation 3,73,73,"This game was the Tekken game of my dreams personally. Not only did they give us the established roster of 40 characters from Tekken 6, but they also gave us every Tekken character in history eventually besides the guest character Gon from Tekken 3. I forgot to mention they were all FREE about 13 dlc characters for free. putting the roster over 50 characters. There are so many characters in Tekken Tag 2 that you will not find yourself bored very soon if you are a fan of Tekken or fighting games in general. You need to pay for a 10$ pass to play online but if preordered the game like Bamco suggested you got that for free and 8 of the 13 DLC characters a month early.

The game expanded upon Tekken 6's bound or bounce mechanic. Which was a mechanic used to extend juggles for extra damage. You could now tag your partner character in which allowed for near limitless combo creativity.

If you dont like tag teaming and one character is all you can learn then you could try playing SOLO which mitigated the health and strength difference of having two characters. The game had the classic modes: Arcade, Time attack, Survival, Team battle, Customization, Theater, etc.  Brief, to lengthy character endings the list goes on. This was the first tekken to implement ""tekken tunes"" meaning you could download old sound tracks from previous tekken games and play them on TTT2 or play songs that are loaded on your system seamlessly looped without any editing required.

The customiztion while some people think the predecessor was better i thought it was pretty decent. Bamco introduced custom decals which allowed you to turn a regular shirt or pair of pants into your own design. Ive seen many clever outfits with this addition.

The game is very balanced:Of course there are top tiers in any fighting game but i feel like with the tag mechanic and the balancing of pokes, launchers and juggles... Bamco really did a good job with this game. NOW COULD IT GET CRAZY? Yes but that's to be expected of any fighter that has juggles.

Tekken Tag 2 also introduced a new graphical feature where the characters would get dirty, sweat, and damp if in water. The game runs at 720p max but its a good damn 720p. Trust me

All in all i think of this game as a great deal especially in this economic climate of games. I mean... we got quality stages(some based off of real places), music, EXTRA LARGE roster for the price of 60$ flat... Tekken 7 is on season 3 with dlc characters and only recently surpassing Tekken 6's roster about 45$s later.",10,2019-09-05,Vishis,False
Kingdom Hearts III,PlayStation 4,654,500,"Utter Disney garbage that is infecting and dragging down a company struggling to remain relevant.

While a well made Action role playing game affair (and after its development cycle it had better be) it amounts to a convoluted mess trying to wrap up a fever dream collaboration between Square Enix and the single most evil corporation to ever exist in all of human history. The result is pure abomination from its narrative driven focus.

Haphazardly thrown together Disney themed set pieces to button mash away at endlessly, much the same as its precursors and the only mildly better PS4 bretheren Final Fantasy XV. Once you peel away the nostalgia for the previous games you see it is little more than an carbon copy of other, better games of which even its prior installments produced better.

Literally not worth anyone's time and attention but due to the utter brainwashing **** into Disney addled zealotry, Square Enix could have rolled out the shiniest polished lawn cigar and the adult aged children that were given Kingdom Hearts on previous consoles as a surrogate for parenting will cheer along gleefully chomping down every nutty bite of this mediocre cud.

Multiplayer is fun if you liked Modern Warfare (2019), but it's still in a somewhat rough state & could be better (plus it seems like the issues of Vanguard's post-launch support are rearing their ugly head again).

Braid,PC,122,122,"Overrated. Wait, before you disagree, just hear me out. This is a good game. A great game, actually. The gameplay is smooth, the artstyle is brilliant and the character design is interesting. The puzzles are each unique and fun to figure out. The story is, well, its there, somewhere. My only real problem with Braid is the fact that the creator deliberately made the game without any discernible story. The creator himself has stated that their is more than one interpretation of the story and that he ""would not be capable"" of explaining it. So, the game has no story. It's just a bucketful of theories and ideas. But, don't give up on it, the game does have moral lessons embedded within the gameplay and ""story"". The most obvious theme is that the past cannot be reversed. What's done is done. While the story is different than normal games, and can turn many people away due to its vague nature, it's still interesting and a fresh take on both platformers and modern story-driven games. In my opinion, Braid shines due to its artistic aspect. The backgrounds in this game are amazing. Everything is, or at least seems to be, painted by hand. If not by hand, then in a ""painterly"" style, as the summary states. The character designs are simple, but very different and interesting when compared to other modern platformers. In conclusion, I would say that Braid is a unique game with a very vague, poignant and atypical story that will evoke a different theory from every individual that plays. While not a bad thing, it does not follow the traditional building blocks or plot outline that most games go by, and this can make it an unenjoyable experience for some. I give Braid a 7.5/10. Mostly because of how short the game is.",7,2012-05-31,CulturalFiend,False

Street Fighter V,PlayStation 4,466,466,"The visuals are fine and stylized. The combat as smooth and fluid. But that's about it. The **** Capcom is at it again with charging $60 for an unfinished product. Similar to how they had content already on the disc at release locked behind a paywall in Street Fighter X Tekken.

The game was released with an incredibly small roster, incredibly small stage selection, no story mode, and still no arcade mode an entire year later. I bought this game earlier this year for $15 on ebay and still felt incredibly ripped off despite what had been added by then. I can't imagine how angry I would've been if I had paid full price on release day.

While I definitely am one to prefer quality over quantity, the low quantity lacks any quality as well. Street Fighter V does nothing to grow the fighting game genre which is already having plenty of trouble on its own. The greediness of Capcom will be the death of them soon if they keep this up.

Tomb Raider,PlayStation 3,323,323,"Tomb Raider lets us into the store of Lara Crofts origins, and her evolution from a mere adventurer to a true survivor, and of course, the tomb raider.

I must be honest here; when I first saw this game, I thought it was going to be dull and pretentious, another release of abhorrent mainstream trash that is constantly spewed our way by these so-called ""developers"". I was so wrong about that, and feel I must never judge a game by mere snippets of gameplay ever again.

You see, Tomb Raider is a big game. I'm saying this, and I haven't even touched the multiplayer yet. The story is expansive and rather detailed, certainly very captivating. There are many different collectibles to find, tombs to raid, and weapons to upgrade (oh yes; LOTS of upgrades). Let's start with the story.

Having washed up on the shores of Yamatai, an island infamous for it's tendency to swallow adventures whole, Lara is soon knocked down, and woken inside a dark, dreary cave. She must get out, and it's here that the game instantly gets to show off it's physics engine; ropes swing the way they should, fire burns the way it should, and Lara...well, Lara falls the way she should. Right into a jutting metal pole, in fact. This the beginning setup to a fantastic adventure throughout the island, to save her friends, and escape Yamatai, discovering secrets along the way.

As I just mentioned, the game features a fantastic physics engine, which is used to solve puzzles throughout the game, as well as bypass obstacles and eliminate foes. The game feels almost free, although you are enclosed in specific areas. Each area, however, has a good deal of things to collect and areas to explore, including tombs, which are effectively Tomb Raiders' little side puzzles, rewarding you with salvage (used to upgrade weapons) upon completion.

And with that, I will move onto the upgrade system. Each weapon in Tomb Raider has it's own set of upgrades, which not only enhance performance, but also change visually. Collecting weapon parts allow you to transfer your current weapon into something far more powerful, unlocking more upgrades along the way. You will start off with an old, flimsy bow, and end up with a deadly sports bow; an old Thompson can be transferred into a fully fledged assault rifle, and so on. It's not only the weapons with upgrades, but Lara herself can be upgraded, giving you new abilities, enhanced senses, and deathly new tactics to use in a firefight, this upgrades are more than just window shopping.

The combat is brutal, and the game is full of set pieces in which you must escape from falling bridges, collapsing planes, burning villages, and more. It also makes use of an uncharted-style climbing system, giving you a little break between gunning down foes and puzzling over challenges. This adds a vital diversity to the game, and it works.

Ultimately, Tomb Raider is the game you HAVE to buy if you have the money, and considering it's currently free on PS+, there has never been a more opportune time to give your survival reflexes a run. Flawless game.",10,2014-03-15,Steeliosis,False

Outlast,PlayStation 4,162,162,"A genuinely frightening and unsettling experience which is extremely brutal and twisted. In this day and age with so many ""Horror"" games on the market its refreshing to find a game that actually provides scares.
Made by an Indie publisher with 12 developers Outlast is the perfect example of the result **** of people with one focus, to scare the bejesus out of the player, create a memorable experience and do it well.
Outlast is a sleeper hit, its a ""Hard R"" and from the first few minutes to the last it proves it.
It takes a while to get used to the fact that you can't fight back and your only avenue for survival is to run and hide. Armed with nothing more than a camcorder with night vision you navigate a mental asylum while trying to avoid being torn to shreds by the patients who have taken it upon themselves to redecorate using each other's intestines and blood.
Jump scares are aplenty, however none feel cheap, everything is really well planned out, from the quite moments to the pack your undies and gap it sections.
Admittedly it took me a while to get into Outlast due to the difficulty curve and adjusting to the game play and darkness. The game looks great even though its as dark as it is. The sound effects and music are phenomenal and the story is pretty good if you pay attention.
Overall, Outlast is a 9. Its not for everyone, due to the sneaker/survival/run and hide nature of the game and the ultra violence. For those of you looking for something different and if you've got a strong stomach and patience I highly recommend it.

I managed get to the last area and can honestly say my time was mostly filled with frustration over the ridiculously small inventory sizes. Most my time was spent uselessly managing loot and going back and fourth to town to sell.

Also the sheer amount of potion vomit was so lame. I can see why the newer game did away with potions like this in favor of a refreshing potion. Being bombarded by all these potions and junk loot felt ridiculous. That felt like such a massive design flaw keeping the loot system like this and the inventory this tiny but maybe how they artificially made games longer back then.

But oh boy I was wrong I wish I bought it the day it got released. This game is so good in every way. Fighting mechanics, running mechanics, story and graphics are so much better in this game and playtime is so much longer. I get that people don't like this kind of game but don't come and say the first mirror's edge is better than this game (I would even go that far and say that the people who say that didn't even play the first game) because they have improved everything in such an awesome way and the previous mirrors edge doesnt offer anything that this game doesn't offer, not even missions..  If you loved the first title, you sure won't be disapointed in any way. But if you compare mirror's edge open world  to GTA V's open world then sure you will be disapointed.

The scenarios are not the most inspired of the JRPG and the enemies comply, although it calls to plan and make the secondary content to take advantage and improve weapons.

I insist, it may appeal to a large audience, but I think they are going to a specific niche. At least I got a good impression in general that is declining as the hours of play go by.

The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD,Wii U,104,104,"Ten years later, it's pretty clear to see how TP is just kind of okay. While the HD remake has upped the texture resolution and improved the graphics, it doesn't fix the fact that this game's aesthetics are stuck in the middle 2000's, an era of games obsessed with bloom, blandness and the color brown.

Second, while the dungeons are fantastic, the overworld is desolate and empty, providing few things to collect and explore. This may have been acceptable eight years earlier with the rudimentary N64 Zeldas, but there's no excuse for a Wii launch title/late Gamecube title to have such a lifeless world.

And finally, the story in this game is laughably bad. A large part of it is salvaged by the charisma of the main character, Midna, but the actual conflict is poorly written, underdeveloped and needlessly complicated.

TP is a treat for gamers who have never played a Zelda game or for series fans who want a game full of OoT fanservice and coolness for the sake of coolness. But as a game standing on its own, ten years of distance has proved this game is just sort of okay.

Dead by Daylight,PC,350,350,"This is a game fuelled by toxicity. Derived from the fact that it is very unbalanced, you play a Killer against four Survivors. One would think the Killer would be the power role, but it is not.

- What they have done is so that Killers are basically toys for the other players, like... there is a Killer that is blind when using his power... imagine.

- Cheating is tolerated. Reports do nothing and also developers allow for a mode called Survive With Friends in which players can abuse on voice communications and play with their friends against an anonymous Killer. There is also ""Kill Your Friends"" but no one plays that one because cheating and trolling one of your friends ain´t that funny.

It´s the only game where mods have to constantly ban people on forums, even in the official forum you need authorization by an Admin in order to create an account where they ask you why do you want to register. At the end game, people would insult and say BRUTAL and unacceptable things - even for Internet - and go unpunished.

Battlefield 1,Xbox One,188,188,"Battlefield 1 is the fresh breath of air we needed in a time where most FPS shooters continued to dive even farther into the future, but Battlefield 1 took the world by surprise by going to one the most horrific wars that ever happened, World War I. With a emotion driven single player, an amazing game engine, a beautiful original score, and an addictive multiplayer, Battlefield 1 is the game FPS fans have been asking for. The single player campaign or, ""War Stories"", is so emotional from the open prologue mission to the very last story, that it kept me engaged and gave me goosebumps throughout each of the missions. With the cutscenes throughout the missions, it was like watching a movie, the motion capture was so realistic, it even had me fooled on knowing the difference between a video game and real life. Each character felt human and you could feel the raw emotion that they were expressing throughout the critical moments in the missions. The multiplayer as I said is addictive and hard to take your eyes off of, it is so amazing, the most satisfying part is the destruction which is amped up to max with improved detail. The new game mode, ""Operations"", is the showcase game mode in multiplayer where both sides fight to capture sectors of map until capture each control point, and of course all the original game mode are back in all their glory like, ""Rush"", and ""Conquest"", and now their is, ""Team DM"", ""Domination"", and a another new game mode, ""War Pigeons"". The arsenal of weapons at your disposal is big, really big, there is a lot to choose from, from the normal standard issue weapons that most known to in service in the war, to the exotic weapons that make every side evenly powered. This is a WWI game based on WWI, it is a historical game but it is more inspired by it than being a historically accurate game, but it is nonetheless a great tribute to all those who served in WWI. For someone like me who is a big Halo, and Call of Duty fan, I have suddenly became a huge fan of Battlefield 1 and the series, I really prefer this game over Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Like most people, we were hoping that Call of Duty would go back in time rather than going forward in time, but no one expected Battlefield to take the route, but they have amazed me more than Bad Company 2 amazed me when I first played it.

Let's start about the gameplay, this is like a puzzle and most of the time you have to explore by your own to keep advancing, so most of the time you have to be with a guide in your mobile. Graphics, sounds, soundtrack are all really good. Trico, the monster, although it's a mixture of many animals, looks real. Its movements, growlings, everything. But the kid looks like cartoons which it's been made on purpose but I don't quite like it. My main complaint is the puzzle style gameplay. i'm a patient person but I don't like to be around without knowing what to do. I think this game would have been better if they give you some advices or at least give you this option.

Madden NFL 21,PC,142,142,"Gameplay
Das wichtige zuerst, das Gameplay. Ein Spiel macht nur so lange spaß wie auch das Gameplay stimmt. Nun schauen wir uns Madden an,
dann können wir sagen, es hat seine schönen Momente, doch man fühlt sich als Spieler ""verarscht"" wenn das Spiel anfängt im dritten Quarter
irgendwelche nicht sinnvollen Animationen abzuspielen. Das Spiel ist allgemein sehr Animationsbasiert, es kann durchaus sein das ihr euren gegenüber
umstoßt der auf dem Boden liegt und plötzlich wieder steht, weil eine andere Animationgreift. Das sind dinge, die sollte man 2020 abgestellt haben.
Ich kann hier nur mal als beispiel NBA2k voran bringen. Klar hier gibt es auch Animationen, aber sie schaffen es das jede Animation beendet werden kann
Transition ist hier das Stichwort.
Als nächstes haben wir die AI oder auch KI (also den Computer gegner oder Spieler die vom Computer gesteuert werden). Diese gibt es nicht beziehungsweise
laufen die ihre vorgegeben Routen ab, weswegen sich auch jeder Spieler gleichanfühlt. Das witzige wenn ihr 3 Cover Spielt und ein Spieler läuft hinter die blaue markierung
kann es sein das er dort eifnach stehen bleibt. Wenn ihr im Ballbesitzt seid, dann haben die Computer kollegen wirklich schlechte Pursuit ankles weswegen ihr alle im ZickZack
auslaufen könnt und verlasst euch nur nicht auf eure Leadblocking leute oder allgemein auf irgendwelche Blocks, die gibt es nur sehr selten. Die AI ist eine Katastrophe und bei einem
spiel bei dem von 22 leuten 21 AI sind naja...
Allgemein fühlt sich das Gameplay sehr nach Skript und Glücksspiel an. Versucht wird auch oft eifnach das Spiel auszuspielen und nicht wirklich zu Spielen.
Jeder Spieler fühlt sich gleich an, das ist fakt, man versucht das mit irgendwelche X-factor Arcade game mechanics auszubessern, es fühlt sich aber mehr wie ein Pflaster an.
Zudem ist es unrealisitisch, warum sollte ein Mahomes nachdem 3 Wurf hintereinander (+50 Yards) plötzlich jedes mal noch weiter werfen können, Ausdauer? Anstrengung keine Spur.

Franchise Mode
Es gibt nichts neues, weiterhin die alten Bugs weiterhin die alten 8 gesichter aus denen ihr auswählen dürft, wenn ihr euer eigenes Roster zusammenstellt.
Die UI ist neu und sieht hübsch aus, weiste bei mir aber viele Bugs auf.

Face of the Franchise
Es ist der langweiligste Modus. Ich habe mich ein wenig gefreut, zwei season im college danach NFL etc. naja man wird nur von einem Spiel ins nächste mit Zeitsprüngen geworfen.
Und die Spiele die ihr macht sind egal, ich habe alle meine College Games mit mehr als 100+ Punkten gewonnen und der Coach sagte trotzdem ich soll zum Draft oder die Position Wechseln.
Sinn?
Die Charaktere die man trifft sind alle langweilig und könnten aus jedem B-Movie Film stammen, wie auch das Drehbuch. Der einzig coole Charakter sind Snoop

Madden Ultimate Team
Nie Gespielt kein Fan von

The Yard
Witziger Modus, aber das wars dann auch schon. Es ist auch schön zu sehen, das man mittlerweile Mouthpieces drin hat und gesichter erstellt werden können, aber
der langweilige Franchise Modus hat das nicht, weil sie dafür kein geld verlangen können.

Fazit
NFL sollte die Lizenz zur Simulation für andere Entwickler Studios öffnen. Es sollte die Chance bestehen, dass neben EASports ebenfalls ein Konkurrent (egal ob 2k oder sonst wer)
ein Spiel mit der NFL Lizenz erstellt. Ich werde mir kein Madden Titel mehr holen (habe jedes madden seit 08) und vorallem EA nicht mehr unterstützen, dass was mit Madden passiert, passiert

The Evil Within,PlayStation 4,484,484,"I went in with high expectations and to put it briefly...I overall enjoyed it, but was below my very high expected 9.5/10.

The game tries to be a psychological mind bender, making you question the reality of the situation and makes you wonder what could come next.

The Bad first (everything is subjective to taste):
- You die...ALOT. Sometimes you just want to move forward.
- I'm absolutely not a fan of black bars
- 30fps give it a slow paced feeling as it should be, but frame rates easily drop when this is done.
- Confirm too frequent frame rate drops, but this can be easily fixed in future updates.
- Graphics are no where as good as I hoped.
- Story not well explained most of the time, or at least don't explain who is who and why.
- movements feel sluggish at times where accurate stealth movements are necessary.

The good:
- You die...ALOT. This is a bad and a good thing. The replay ability of each level doesn't feel frustrating, but much more a challenge for you to go back and try **** different ways all the time.
- Great horror atmosphere and very nice first Chapter. I don't want to spoil more..
- (SPOILER) Love the Silent Hill 2 reference with the look of the nurse when in the save game dreams.
- Each level is unique in its own way with always something intriguing to look forward to. Most of the time.
- This game is a survival horror. You will feel exactly that when playing it. You are surviving. THAT is something many games don't have anymore.

You make one wrong ****, you're dead. It isn't a perfectionists game, but it requires planning and thinking on how to proceed forward in each level. You will make full use of your environments and once you learn the tricks you will enjoy the game to the fullest.

I expected a better told story, better graphics without those dreadful black bars that remove 2 thirds of my screen space (literally). Improve the controls, make the bars a choice and improve the frame rate.

That being said, if you're looking to play online by yourself without mics well in my opinion this game is pretty much unplayable and can be very frustrating (unless you're playing as the monster of course).

Assassin's Creed Unity,PlayStation 4,748,500,"The cons:
- The framerate is choppy at times (20fps on very rare occasions, feels much more like 30 most of the time) but not unplayable at any stage, most likely down to the amount of characters on screen at once, hopefully this gets fixed soon.
- Theres quite a few funny glitches and bugs and few that get you stuck on collision and on a few occasions fell through the world, fast travel usually fixes it.
-Graphics fall short when atop buildings and having the vista of paris and all it's complexities.

The pros:
- Combat is actually harder, the sweet spot for countering is tighter and the animations from enemies are less suggestive, you have to really be on your toes and use your full arsenal.
- Fresh setting with the best interiors seen in a third person game.
- Movement is the most fluid out of all of the creed games.
- Ascend and descend style of free-running which makes far more sense when getting up to those sync points and wanting to come down fast.
- Removed the factions, they were fluff in the past games with injected unnecessary story, they made the game feel very arcady.
- Enemies don't follow you across rooftops but have improved chasing skills on the ground, gives a lot more purpose to rooftops.
- No more instant win with calling assassins out of no where.
- Coop is AMAZING, think splinter cell chaos theory but with roles for each assassin, I just wish they were harder than they currently are.
- Customisation is one of the biggest pluses in this game, you have such a huge array of options, head, chest, waist, hands and legs along with all the different types of weapons.
- Turn off any HUD element (which can be most of them once you get used to the game).

The verdict:
Wait around a month for all the bugs to smooth out as it appears that most people overly care about this.

The visuals themselves are stunning, but unfortunately I think the Wii U is just not up to the task of rendering them smoothly.

I tried to get into this game 3 times but couldn't get over how muddy it feels.  Perhaps if they port it to the NX, I'll give it another shot.  But my other concern is the poor level design.  Levels were much too long with too much emphasis on exploration that leads nowhere (e.g. water areas where you just collect bananas).

LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga,PlayStation 5,146,146,"The best Lego game ever made, the attention to detail is astounding and this is easily the biggest and best Lego game ever. it's larger then TFA, it's larger then LMSH2, it's larger then DC Super-Villains, if you want me to be honest nothing else comes close when it comes to Lego games, nothing.

TT really outdid themselves this time, reworked and balanced combat system, saber, blaster, and hand-to-hand combat has never felt better.

Mountains of quests for every era, far and away one of their biggest rosters of all time, if not the biggest roster they've ever done.

Tons of planets to explore, each of which are large and expansive with many different zones and areas.

It never outstays it's welcome like a lot of other Lego games, main quests are quick and to the point, no convoluted puzzles that'll leave you scratching your head for like 20 minutes trying to figure out what to do.

The voice-acting is a bit... off in places, but besides that it's phenomenal and done very well, made me and my nephew laugh very hard at points. My only other complaint is a personal one and that's that they didn't include more expanded universe content, only stuff from shows and movies, would've liked to see RC-1138 AKA Boss from Republic Commando, or Revan from KOTOR, since this may well be the very last Star Wars outing we'll see from TT it would have been great to see a lot of those characters.

Either way, this turned out to be phenomenal, congrats to TT, and thank you for all the work you put in. The series you started on ended on the highest note possible.

Mass Effect,PC,431,431,"To begin with let me tell you the following: I played both the Xbox and PC versions and I can tell you, must tell you to get a 360 controller for your PC to play it. Mass Effect has been designed to be controlled with a game pad.

The game looks fantastic; I got it running at 1280x768 px in full-screen mode -all settings in medium and no dynamic shadows- on a AMD Phenom II X4 920 at 2.80 GHz with 4 GB of RAM and a Nvidia GeForce 210 card with 1Gb of DDR2 RAM. I only experienced some hiccups when the engine threw at me lots of fogging and heavy water effects. If your computer is even worse than mine, you can drop the resolution to 1024x768 on the windowed mode and it'll do pretty good. For a 3 year-old game it still looks amazing: water surfaces, reflections, textures and the lightening are terrific.

The gameplay is reminiscent of Gears of War with RPG elements thrown in as our squad members can access their abilities either passively by means of battle menu or actively using the keyboard short-cuts. We control commander Shepard that can either be female or male and whose face we can design to our own liking; Shepard is the only character we can fully control as the rest of them, members of our squad, are semi-automatic. Our active squad is composed by three party members and they can be ordered to move forward, backward, attack or defend and we can also access their skills through the passive battle menu. These skills come in the form of biotic powers, mainly telekinetic abilities such as pull, push, force shield and space distortion: biotics are Mass Effect's gameplay core and a lot of fun. Apart from shooting and using biotic skills in a back third person perspective there are several missions that require vehicle driving and shooting: the Mako. These missions usually are pretty straight-forward however fun; the Mako is equipped with a rail gun and a cannon and both will heat and shut down temporarily after repeated and heavy use: the Mako will also take damage that can be repaired using omnigel paks. The Mako will also serve to explore the different planets that will be visited, on which resources and secrets can be found to progress the story, unlock features and improve the equipment. There are more RPG elements than using biotic powers, weapons and armours can be purchased and upgraded and the game is heavily scripted as well with multiple conversation choices to pick leading to different results.

Even though I suggested getting a console controller to play it, using the keyboard-mouse combination has its advantages because we can assign more than two buttons to the special abilities. The mouse is used to target and move the camera around as well as the Mako turret, the left button is for shooting and the right button is for precise targeting. The space bar is for bringing up the passive battle menu and the shift key for running like in Gears of War. Fortunately, the control setup allows mouse inversion and tweaking for all the key assignments.

The sound quality of the game is really good but not impressive overall however its voice acting is terrific and this is where this aspect of the game shines.

The musical score is futuristic and serves its purpose wonderfully yet it is not memorable with the exception of the end-titles song.

The story is really engaging and well written with several plot twists. Each team member has their own and we get to know them by means of the several conversations available through the course of the game. The best part of the scripting is how much detail Bioware put into the universe to make it plausible: they went to the extent of adding an encyclopaedia with all the game scientific and biological terminology as well as planetary information and entries on the alien races' civilizations. There is so much thought put into this universe unlike most of the other sci-fi games released except the Xenosaga series, which is even more complex. The whole universe sustains itself in a wonderful and believable way thanks to the writer's wit that allowed them to come up with technology and scientific concepts not far away from our current reality and what we might consider possible.

The art is not impressive in a complicated way: its functional, it suits the universe and serves to sustain the fictional world of the script yet it is not original. Some planets are beautiful and breath-taking and the Normandy has been wonderfully designed. There is a lot of simplicity put into the art design that fortunately highlights the overall impression rather than making it dull nonetheless most planetary surfaces and facilities are repetitive with the same type and distribution of elements within them.

All in all, Mass Effect is one of the best games ever released: it has wonderful graphics, a fantastic voice acting, entertaining gameplay and a very well written and cohesive fictional world; there isn't much else that anybody can ask for a good game to be good and Mass Effect covers all of these aspects superbly.

MechWarrior Online,PC,578,500,"Mechwarrior Online is the newest title in the series of Mechwarrior games. It is a Free To Play Game. Unlike its predecssors, it is a pure online PvP game. There is no campaign or story node and no Player vs Enemey combats.
As a mechwarrior game, it is based on the Battletech Table Top game and as a mechwarrior title, it puts you in the position of the pilot of a mighty, heavily armed and armoured war machine fighting together with 11 team mates against 12 others. In the Mechwarrior business, we like to call this ""Big Stompy Robot Fights"".

= Gameplay =
The gameplay is a mix of an FPS (now also with 3PV camera drone mode) and (walking) tank simulator. The controls are on the more complex side of things. You can twist your torso (similar to a tank's turret) seperately from your legs, and you can also move your arms seperately. Mechs consist of multiple hit locations  (like Center Torso, Left Rear Torso, Right Arm etc) with seperate hit points for each location, and each location containing items that will be lost if the hit location is destroyed. The mechs are customizable to some extent in their weapon loadout, armor distrubtion, engine and other equipment, and each mech comes in multiple variants with slight diffferentiation in model or possible loadouts.
You queue up for a match alone or with friends, and the match-maker tries to pit two equally strong 12 man teams against each other on a randomly selected map and with a randomly selected game mode.
There is currently no lobby feature, though there is one announced for the future.

= Character Advancement =
For each match you pla you earn C-Bills and XP depending on your performance (kills, assists, spotting, win/loss). You spend C-Bills to buy mechs, weapons or other equipment, and you can use XP to unlock mech efficiencies (passive buffs to mech stats, like torso twist range or maximum heat threshold before shutdown) and modules (slottable buffs or even active abilities). You start the game only with access to trial mechs, which cannot be customized. You earn bonus C-Bills for the first 25 matches so you can afford your own mech soon.
Overall, the advancement is relatively slow and shallow. The mech efficiencies are the same for every mech, there is only a small number of modules, and if you want to gain all mech efficiencies for a mech, you also have to buy variants of the same mech.

= Long Term Motivation and Metagame =
When the title was announced, community warfare was intended to act as metagame and provide long-term motivation. Community Warfare means you fight for a faction (be it as part of it, as a merc corp, or as a lone wolf) and gain or lose territory for that faction, and earn loyality.
This feature is not implemented yet, so currently, there is very little long term motivations or metagame.
Without any lobbies, there is no easy way to organize player-run tournaments or leagues, though that hasn't stopped players from trying.

= Game Balance =
Being a PvP only title, balance becomes a naturally important topic to players. Without game balance, the many mech build choices are quickly narrowed down to the few good options, and the overall enjoyment drops due to lack of variety and surprises. Be warned that this is one of my ""favorite"" topics and I might be the least subjective here.
The game balance is still not in a good state.
Some of the problems arose from underlying systems.
The heat system (a core component of any Battletech derived game) effectively makes balancing weapon stats much more difficult. The stats for weapons come basically from a game that worked very differently, and so it just won't fit together well. Mech armor values are derived from the table top game, too, ignoring that there is a big difference between randomly rolled hit locaitons and mouse-aimed hit locations (with all FPS typically conceits added in).
There are also technical issues that affect game balance, like the hit detection still not being reliable (sometimes dependent on mech models) and imbalanced hit box sizes.
Personally I am having the impression (impression  fact) that the development team is not prepared to analyize their own game design well enough, and are also a bit unwilling to accept critique or change certain systems due to their own emotional investment in them. (As I said, this part will be very subjective. Make up your own mind, if you're interested enough in the game.)

= Advice =
If you like stompy robot fights, or a battletech fan, check the game out. But the current game is not really worthy  a released title, lacking too many features and still having too many shortcomings. There have been many delays and changes of stated goals (some might speak of broken promises and lies).
I'd carefully consider spending any money on the game in its current state.
Rating is 5/10. It might improve with future features, depending on their quality. (+1.5 for Community Warfare, +1.5 for Balance, +1 for game modes and +1 for advancement)",5,2013-09-18,MustrumRiduclly,False

Alien: Isolation,PC,549,500,"If I was forced to sum it up Alien: Isolation (A:I) in only one sentiment I would say this. We like our sci-fi films to have the best sci-fi in them. In A:I the sci-fi is intense.

From the very start I was deeply impressed. Once I was fully exploring the Savastopol station, I was in awe at the graphics. Settings on full presents visuals out of this world. With good sound equipment like quality headphones the audio is stunning. Technically it is AAA in every way. It's like a movie set, and saying that I am not being pretentious.

Onto the alien. It's scary consistently and I didn't expect that. I guess many of us have read the alien behaviour is not-scripted. This means its path is not pre-determined beyond being made to visit the vicinity you are at. I have heard myself having the thought, ""It's real"", because it behaves in a natural manner. I think once the 'it's real' has passed through your mind you're in a world of fear. On reflection I felt I was in a virtual reality world with a live creature.

I think my main concern about the alien presumably not being killable doesn't really come into game-play. I think the point is that the alien is so fast is that if you try, you only get a couple of rounds off. It is capable of surviving that easily before it gets to the kill.

If you play as I did, moving carefully, those save-points came along just right. Every time I saw a save-point, I got the emotion, ""Oh you beauty."" The achievement of every lever pulled, or item collected or crafted, was safe.

Conclusion: With A:I having other enemies it actually delved into a stealth-shooter experience. However the shooting and using Molotovs and stuff, is massively dispersed with lots of tasks and hiding parts in between.

It took me thirty-six hours to complete. My score rating for A:I is 9.6/10 and the highest I have ever rated a game. I am honestly critical, and will not overlook issues, however A:I didn't present any. The visuals got a little bland in one section and that was all the complaint I could manage. Even when I was hiding under a desk, or in a cupboard for ages I was not bored. I was either watching intently the tracker, loving the graphics around me, or watching an alien.",10,2014-12-31,Neddy,False
Mafia III,Xbox One,93,93,"Xbox One. I'm suprised at the low review scores. Mafia 3 has a wonderfully detailed and lively environment, streets and residential areas feel more alive than most games i've played and it's the main source of praise from me, the city has great flow, they've made it very accessible, especially on foot. Random encounters were well thought out, conversations both on the street and with characters were relevant to my progress within the story. The world was so lovely to be in that I often found myself listening out a top song and simply watching the world go by before entering a mission marker. The gameplay and story were both very good, it all felt crisp and well written, I loved the call out system for guns, cars and bank. The soundtrack is, by far, the best I've ever heard and was worth the price alone, it will never be bettered in a game. The driving took a while to get used to but after a few hours and some upgrades it became a really enjoyable experience with some epic drifts and high speed close shaves, the traffic density is just right, and with that soundtrack I often found myself getting in the zone.

A few down sides, a few more side missions and some side activities would be nice. It require's a more detailed combat system, especially melee. Father James is painful to listen too and his character is unconvincing, can - he - talk - any - slower. Lighting is unstable. The game crashed 3 times in roughly 40 hours of play. Frame rate dropped a tiny bit at points towards the end of the game. The solid bushes everywhere felt a little bit quick and cheap, bushes aren't solid objects! Give us the option to create a save point, we should be free to save, load and back up as we please.

Detroit: Become Human is the ultimate middle finger to black experiences and suffering, coming from the perspective of a French studio that has, in the past, used racist caricatures in their games. The subtlety in this game is equal to that of the game beating your head in with a heavy mallet. There is none. Any attempts to be non-offending, to be non-racist, are steamrolled over by black androids singing slave songs and running away on the android ""railroad.""

Mass Effect,PC,431,431,"I was... surprised, I admit it.
I never thought that I would love this videogame as much as I do! I seriously have to thank my friends for their recommendation :)
The story was brilliant and very well developed, it kept me at the edge of my seat until I finished it. The graphics were stunningly beautiful and the pacing of it managed to keep me interested in everything that was shown here. I didn't manage to complete a lot of side-quests but the ones I did were entertaining and quite funny, actually.
The characters in general had a certain level of complexity that captivated me along the way and sometimes I would choose other options to just see them talk about things that happened in their past.
But the most interesting aspect of Mass Effect was the capacity of making your own choices and deciding which dialogues your main character would say and how their ending was going to be. That, in my opinion, is what makes ME such a unique game in this industry.

Dark Souls Remastered,PlayStation 4,378,378,"Dark souls remastered is an okay release how ever it has gotten several issues. The remaster still left countless bugs and glitches like soul duplications, easy cheese strats and skips. They could have taken the time to fix some of these  Moving on to the game itself I personally didn't like some of Dark souls features. Like the huge lack of warp locations. I can't think of any reason why they had so few of these. You end up having to sometimes walk several minutes just go to a level you need to revisit after beating it already? Sometimes there is hole areas without a single warp location yet other areas there is 2. It's tedious and annoying. Especially when your previous game had a decent amount of them. A few of the levels on dark souls I'm really not a fan of and not for the difficulty. I hate when games have invisbke floors. It looks like a bug that hasn't been patched. And you get MSG's in the game anyway so you can tell where they are if someone has wrote on them. It's just a cheap way to add difficulty. And another level where it's so dark even with the brightness on the game and TV ramped up to max you still can't see anything. So you can be walking as slow as possible hit a ledge then fall. It's extremely frustrating. It's like a hooror movie with crappy cheap jump scares instead of designing something that is scary without making you jump. That takes really good design and creative thinking. From software is capable in this as when you goto Demon Souls the prison was a great map. Or even the dlc in dark souls where those ghost things are. Dark souls is no doubt a good game. With a decent variety in spells. Loads of weapons and great bosses.

Might & Magic: Heroes VI,PC,193,193,"I have been a huge fan of this franchise. It makes me feel exceptionally old to think about how many years ago I played the first Heroes of Might and Magic. I purchased II, III, IV, V, and most recently VI, but I have played every game in the series. As the series has progressed, there have been great improvements as well as disappointing setbacks. V was one of the most innovative of the series. The beautiful 3d rendering and ability to spin the camera view were wildly successful innovations. The only real complaints anyone could make about V was that the races were not very well balanced, there were not enough custom maps / NO custom campaigns, and the game could sometimes be glitchy before the patches. VI is as radical a departure from V as V had been from previous versions of this game. Many of the innovations in V that were great have been removed, e.g. No more 3d maps/battlefields, no more control over camera angle. For those who played V you will immediately think the controls are broken because you cannot swing the screen around and look at different angles. The campaigns are fun and challenging, the new powerup/levelup scheme is innovative and interesting, if not a bit troublesome to get used to. The biggest reason this game is getting only a 6 from me is because the game is glitchy... severely. The game was released unfinished(perhaps in beta), and over a year later the bugs have still not been worked out. This is shameful. I have been trying to enjoy this game and find myself frustrated with a game that sometimes crashes for seemingly no reason. Ubisoft needs to get its act together if they want loyal fans of the series to buy VII. I am not saying not to buy this. I have no regrets about the purchase, but I waited till the game went on sale.

However, it has two of those ""don't make any mistake"" type achievements that require you to restart the whole mission; one involving avoiding obstackles while driving a car, the other is making perfect quick time events via keypresses. This latter made me curse a lot and I still don't have it. At very first, I managed to get to 75% and had to start over. I spent the next 2 hours trying and failing between 10-40% progress; very annoying. At one time, even if I pressed the correct key at the right time, the game didn't register it and had to quit.

I run into few technical issues: coudn't change the full-screen resolution and in the tutorial, I threw the grenade too early and the game simply didn't let me continue.",8,2014-06-26,akarnokd,False
Mafia II: Definitive Edition,PC,144,144,"Remaster of the great game with little improvements and tons of bags.
Pros:
- Amazing atmosphere of the Epoque through the nice-looking city and great music
- Interesting plot with many twists
- Cool characters with their own story
- Nostalgia
Cons:
- Empty open world. You don't have anything to do and the game doesn't motivate you to do this - missions go back to back. Also, you don't have a lot of options to spend money: some car upgrades, limited weapon selection, and some clothes
- Poor gameplay. There is no challenge in shooting - you just hide, peek, and kill. All opponents are always in the same position
- The graphics still look straight out of 2010
- Lots of bags. Sometimes you will have to rerun a mission because of them but there is nothing very serious",7,2020-06-06,denbernik,False

Mass Effect,Xbox 360,217,217,"The Mass Effect franchise is one of the most well-established RPG’s of this age, and this is a title it is certainly deserving of. It all started with Mass Effect, which includes the most customization of any of the games in the series however it also includes the most flawed gameplay. The characters and the interesting sci-fi universe are the best part of this game. While the story itself is nothing new, the voice acting is superb and you’ll find that the best moments in this game are when you are chatting with a friend rather than duking it out on the battlefield. In fact, I’m going to go so far as to say the combat is boring and uninteresting.

Therefore it’s such a shame that the battlefield is where you’ll spend a majority of the game  It isn’t that the combat is broken- it is just boring. There is nothing new to it. But that isn’t even the worst part of the combat- the biggest flaw here is the autosave. You’ll often play for 30 minutes and then die and have to go all the way back to the beginning. You’ll have to learn to save on your own but even then if an enemy is remotely nearby  you can’t save. This means you may have to go through the same 30 minutes to an hour of boring combat multiple times so you can progress the story. The only reason I trudged through the missions was so I could get back to the ship and advance my relationships with the other characters and learn about their histories and backstories.

Not only does it  have boring combat, but it has these broken and horrendous driving moments using a vehicle called the Mako which haunts me in my dreams to this day. So then, how could I give this game an 8.5 if I have all  these complaints? Honestly, as I mentioned earlier, it is the characters that make this game. You play as Commander Shepard, a character whom you shape. Shepard can be a boy or girl, black or white, blonde or brown (or any other hair color) and on and on. There is no canon Shepard and you can play as him/her on a good (paragon), bad (renegade), or neutral path. Or you could just go crazy and pick whatever options you want. There is no right playthrough however I’d recommend deciding on whatever you would do/ whatever you think is right for your first playthrough.

You can choose how to advance Shepard’s skills as well as his class, so its up to you whether you want him to be a charismatic leader or a violent over-powered man. This is something which was unfortunately dumbed down in the sequels and is another way that this game immerses you in. You can also upgrade your squad-mates skills but this is optional.

Mass Effect is one of the best games I have ever played, which feels so unusual for me to say considering I found the actual gameplay itself boring. It looks great despite being a few years old and has brought the RPG genre the attention it deserves. Everyone will experience this game in a different way and walk out with a story to tell, and as long as you are patient enough to make it through the monotonous combat sequences then you are in for a real treat.

Full score: 8.5/10

Batman: Arkham Knight,PlayStation 4,1048,500,"I felt it necessary to create an account simply to combat these COMPLETELY unfounded negative reviews, they are doing the game a serious injustice. I'm reading things like ""combat and graphics are great, but it feels like the last games in the series"" or ""this game should not have been released on PC, there are some framerate drops"" or ""Warner Bros is a horrible publisher, too much content cut"" (honestly, this game is jam packed with content, not to mention it comes with 3 pieces of free DLC  right out of the box, this dude must be high) where they then proceed to give the game a whopping ZERO. How unfair! These people have most likely put in a couple hours MAX into this amazing game, and then they come on with relatively minor complaints and give it a ZERO?? When reviewers do this they proceed to lose all credibility, period.  Honestly, pay no attention to these reviews, they are bogus, written by extremely immature gamers who are unable to write objective, fair reviews. All that being said, I AM LOVING THIS GAME! I am around 12 hours into the main story line (I felt that was enough to write this review) and I am truly in awe of this game, the graphics, combat, story, voice acting, writing, new gameplay mechanics. I am in Batman heaven. Yes, the Batmobile is a TAD overused, but it is still FUN, I promise. That is my only ""complaint"" (if you can even call it that). Other than that, so far this is gaming perfection. Rocksteady has proved yet again that they truly know how to make amazing, top shelf games. The current user score is at a surprising and shameful 7.0. This is wildly inaccurate, I can assure you. Seriously guys!? Pay attention to the critic reviews, they tell the true story.  If you loved (or even remotely liked) Arkham Asylum and/or Arkham City, or if you love dark, suspenseful, insanely fun action/stealth games, I could not recommend this game more.

FIFA Soccer 12,PlayStation 3,101,101,"FIFA 12 has taken another step forward in trying to make the game as realistic as possible. *note if you've got problems with the movement you can make it better. Go to gameplay options and then to User player options. You will find horizontal bars you can move up or down. Go to PLAYER MOVEMENT FREQUENCY and push it up to the top and then to FULBACK positioning and push that up too. You should find that the game moves alot better.

after extensive play I give it 8.5

Pro's:
Countless animations meaning greater variety of shots, passes, headers and tackles. Defending is more satisfying although big learning curve. Manager mode is better than last year and the fatigue leading to injuries is a great addition letting you know you need to balance it out and rest some players more, or take the risk if you really need the player. The amount of teams you can be. Creation mode! havent done it yet, but apparently you can create leagues, teams and players and put them in career mode. Tight dribbling controls meaning greater freedom of movement, showing the amount of touches a player actually has on a ball when dribbling and pulling off skills is more satisfying than ever and the added contextual skills and dribbling makes it less predictable. Customisation of options and playability. Assisted, semi-assisted and manual for shooting, passing, crossing, lobbed passes, through balls ect. Fast, medium and slow gameplay options, 2 different types of Nets and how loose you want them to be and if you hate the new defending and you want it to be easier, you can go back to the FIFA 11 settings. All in all you feel you have more control of what the player you control does, whether defending or attacking which gives you a higher sense of responsibility when it comes to a win or lose situation. Goalkeepers are very good this year and the saving animations are very good, e.g. when you are in on goal and close to the keeper he will change his angle more and close his legs if the shots are close to him and the diving across goal if they get the rebound is a fantastic addition. Very good physics engine

Cons:

AI movement is pretty poor and im sometimes left wondering when im attacking what my options are. It feels as though I have to go it alone abit too much. We all get that using alot of skill moves to outfox the defenders and running in on goal to dink it over the keeper is fantastic, as is the occasional 30 yard screamer, but there has to be more options and a greater number of ways to play FIFA. Although the Physics engine is good, it can also be very stupid when your players run into eachother, giving the ball away and having big gaps that get exploited when 2 sometimes 3 of your players are lying on the floor. Referees are still awful. Spending your time one on one with someone like Pato and as you think he has got past you, you stick a leg out and knocks the ball out of play in dramatic fashion. Then the ref points to the spot... horrible. Dribbling is also a con as it can sometimes mean its one paced and struggle to get past a player, although I've had no problem winning the ball in a foot race with a player like Messi against a slower defender, on the ball Messi is a bit slower than what you would expect form players of his calibre.

Player ratings: Arshavin, Walcott, Defoe, Bale ect are seriously overated. I wouldnt say Bale is 2 points ahead of someone like Modric and I definitely wouldnt say he is better than Pedro, Sanchez, among a few others. I also wouldn't put him on the same level as Aguero, just one behind Silva (who is better than Modric but not in FIFA) and one ahead of Pato, Suarez and yaya Toure. There are many more but Im going to stop now and just play the game and enjoy it.",9,2011-09-30,heathyaaj,False
Resident Evil 6,PC,258,258,"Did i like the old REs? Yes. Do i like them now? No. They were good for their time, when technology didn't allow for a lot more than bad controls, camera, motion capture and terrible voice acting was the norm, but they have aged very badly. Revelations and 6 are the evolution that this franchise needed. No longer does your character move like a tank. No longer does it rely on cheap, ineffective horror. It's a full blown action game with great controls, satisfying combat, better writing and voice acting (though it's still nothing special in that area). It's also quite long.. if you don't rush it, it can take you 30 hours to finish all campaigns and then there is still more stuff to do.

Destiny 2: The Witch Queen,PlayStation 5,52,52,"This is Bungie at it's best!
i was skeptical that they'll use the same format from forsaken and beyond light which is quite boring, and i was ready for another boring ride just o prepare myself for the raid, but instead they gave us a better format, different than before that makes every mission feels like a mini or even a full blown strike, combined with legendary difficulty and it perfects the formula for in my opinion, the best campaign format of Destiny's history. And i won't even speak about the story, because trust me, that is one of the reasons why i stay for almost 8 years with this franchise. It's amazing on this one and i can't wait for the next expansion ""Lightfall"" next year.

The rest of the game, the gameplay loop is also interesting. The addition of weapon crafting and an overhaul subclass Void 3.0 is fantastic. One aspect of the weapon crafting that i don't like is the economy side of it, but i guess in the era of content creators, i'll just going to be picky what guns that i'll be chasing to save materials for crafting and let the content creators grinds and reviews every guns combo.

There are still lots of it including the raid that i currently playing, and so far it's fantastic as well.",10,2022-03-06,skinnypixel,False

The scalability of the game allows for players who want to master the puzzles the ability to search for collectibles and try B-sides (harder versions of the levels) or you can turn on Assist mode and just enjoy the excellent level design. Chapters are robust and full of interesting new obstacles. The catharsis that the character goes through on her journey is simple yet profound.

Assassin's Creed Unity,Xbox One,315,315,"I bought into the Ubisoft hype-train much like everyone else with Unity, and was incredibly disappointed. I'm a huge fan of Assassin's Creed, and yet this game lacked what has made the series stand out for me.

Story- The story, which is normally the best part of the games, was dull, and very unoriginal. The story revolved around Arno being in love with Elise, and nothing more. The main character's purpose was completely overshadowed by the other characters who actually had goals outside of personal relationships. But, the modern day story line was even worse than Arno's. In every game in the series, people have complained that the modern day aspect was a distraction, but I always found that it connected the games in a very interesting way. Unfortunately in Unity, the modern day story was exactly what people have been complaining about for years. You are visited in your Helix by two assassins who tell you to find a sage, and when you find the sage, you are told that it doesn't matter because the body would be too hard to find. Also, the Helix will break at three points in the story, sending you across time into different eras of Paris. Although, the idea was interesting, the gameplay really didn't add anything, and just seemed like tests for future games.

Visuals- Arguably the best part of the game, a very impressive Paris was cool to walk around in.

Animations- Animations such as the fighting ones were very good, although a bit unrealistic. Free-running animations were way too flashy for a ""stealth game."" The crowd animations were so poor that I was very aware I was playing a video game any time I was at ground level. You can bull rush through a crowd only slowing down a little bit because any large crowd will part like the Red Sea in an incredibly awkward animation where an NPC will just slide a foot to the side.

Gameplay- Most of the gameplay was a very solid foundation for future games running on this engine. Technical glitches did take away from this, but the gameplay was good. The new fighting system was an improvement over previous titles, making it a bit more challenging by not allowing instant kills. The health bars above enemies also allowed you to see how effective that your weapon is, and the differences between the tiers of weapons. But, taking away the human shield feature while significantly increasing gun damage was a huge mistake. When a rifleman takes aim at you, it can be game over really easily. Free-running took one step forward and two steps back. The new free-run down mechanic was excellent, and very useful. Unfortunately, horizontal movement didn't feel as smooth, and upward movement was slower than it was in Black Flag and 3. The controls for the free running were unresponsive at times which could be incredibly frustrating. No matter how much you play the game, Arno never really feels like he is fully under your control. The stealth did make improvements with the introduction of the crouch and cover systems, but outside of mission areas that were clearly designed for stealth, the stealth gameplay felt no different than any other game. Taking out the whistle feature was also a mistake, as the cherry bombs that were supposed to be a replacement for it did not work.

Customization- The weapons and gear customization worked very well, and made a needed addition to the series. Skill customization was a good idea, but some skill trees were much more involved than others. Namely the melee tree which really only had two options, 1 overall fighting skill, and 1 skill for the weapon class of your choice. Some skills also made no sense as unlockables such as: sitting on a bench or shooting a gun or tuck and roll.

Multiplayer- Co-op missions and heists were good, but really weren't replayable. The free-roam was boring like it was in Watch Dogs. They needed to look at GTA V to see how to make multiplayer free-roam its' own experience by adding several gameplay elements to it. Not just singleplayer free roam with 3 people tagging along side you. And, getting rid of the competitive multiplayer was a dumb decision considering it had much more replay value than the multiplayer that was in the game.

Overall, if you are a fan of assassin's creed you won't like this game very much, and if not, this is not the game to try and get into the series with. The technical problems that marred the launch of the game have been dealt with by the time of writing this, and it probably won't get any better. It still doesn't work perfectly, but it is playable.

Norse Gods, magic and monsters, riding wolves. This game is not Assassins Creed and since odyssey AC has really lost it’s identity.  Bring back the old AC, get rid of the heavy rpg elements, revamp the combat, build a better parkour system, and give us Assassins vs Templar’s.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance,PlayStation 3,256,256,"My major complaint is that the game is short.  And yes, it's ""meant to be replayed,"" but approximately 3 to 4 hours of level CONTENT (not time it takes you to finish) is a lot of money per inch of level.  Whenever they kick out MGR:R2, I'll be buying it, and I still highly recommend buying this one, but I really hope they add a bit more.

The mechanics of this game are rock solid.  The system is probably the most fun I've ever had with an action game, although a lot more could have been done with it to add some variety.  I hope to see some more innovative uses of the ""cut anything"" system in a sequel.

Despite people's complaints about it ""ruining"" the atmosphere of the metal gear games, the story isn't bottom tier.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,PlayStation 5,431,431,"This game has less than 100 MB on the disc. Not GB, MB. Are you freaking kidding me? This makes the physical edition pointless. When I pay a premium price of $70, I expect the campaign and all offline modes to be in the disc. The developers were too cheap and lazy to add all of that in the disc. It requires internet just to be able to play the campaign. I was on the verge of giving this game a negative score for that reason alone, but I would be in denial if I said I didn't have an absolute blast with this game. This game has tons of replay value with the multiplayer. There is even a third person mode in multiplayer.

The campaign has fun and diverse missions, although there are some parts of the campaign that can be annoying. It has good attention to detail and interesting moments. Very well paced. The story was okay I guess, didn't really care much about it. The gunplay and player movement are well designed. The graphics are biblical. The environments look stunning. You can play offline multiplayer, but there are only like 3 maps that you can play offline for some reason.

As I mentioned earlier, internet is required to play the campaign and offline modes. So once the developers decide to switch off the servers, you won't be able to play it unless you keep it installed in the PS5 I assume. I will eventually delete it, so it'll end up in the trash can. And the greedy developers had the audacity to charge $70 for this. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the multiplayer. Ground war is better and more balanced. No longer do I feel defenseless when I see a tank. The customization is good. The maps are well thought out compared to the recent CODs. The inclusion of the border crossing map and the F1 raceway map is a stroke of genius. There is even a third person person mode. The skull on the boxart has a cringeworthy face. This made me remove the cover paper off the game case and rip it into pieces.

Dragon Age: Origins,PC,576,500,"J'ai commencé Dragon Age sur 360 et y ai passé une centaine d'heures et si en termes graphiques Dragon Age ne laissera pas d'empreintes indélébiles dans les mémoires (une façon polie de dire que c'est bien moche sur 360 ! et en plus ça ramouille pas mal !), il en laissera par contre pour ses nombreuses autres qualités qui font de lui un grand jeu de rôle : une histoire narrée avec talent par Bioware, des personnages forts et attachants, une interface bien pensée pour la console, des dialogues nombreux dont l'adaptation VF est un modèle du genre et une durée de vie pharaonesque.

Après la version 360, j'ai refait Dragon Age avec les quelques DLC (ceux qui s'intègrent dans la campagne) mais sur PC cette fois : l'avantage de la vue aérienne compense l'absence du pad (hélas) mais en même temps, l'interface à la souris est un modèle du genre pour ne pas dire la référence, et belle avec ça. Le jeu est plus difficile que sur 360, un minimum de stratégie et de micro-gestion est nécessaire... un système de combat avec pause toujours aussi passionnant quoi qu'il en soit.

Graphiquement inégal certes mais dans l'ensemble encore bien agréable ce Dragon Age et nettement supérieur à la version 360. Exigeant également cela dit, le moteur de Bioware accusant ses limtes parfois. La musique est excellente, l'une sinon la meilleure partition d'Inon Zur très inspiré ici. VF toujours impeccable, Bioware et EA obligent. Une poignée de plantages en 92h (PC oblige) mais rien de rédhibitoire.

L'histoire bien que simple au demeurant est très efficace et les relations avec l'équipe qui compte quelques personnages très intéressants (ah Oghren et Morrigan !) est fort bien menée et les choix ont de réelles répercussions, jusqu'à la fin, jusqu'à ce final absolument grandiose et épique.

Let me go over some of the problems people point out.
-expensive cash shop. This is true the skins are pretty expensive in there but that currently is all that is in there no inventory tabs like in other games or other game play benefits. Looking at you poe -shaky servers
The first few days of a launch are always shaky for the servers of a online game this should be known by now, however with that said I see no reason as to why this game was forced to be always online seems silly to **** it's not the only one in the genre to do this again looking at you poe -the game loop is shallow
I do think there is a bit of a point here but only if you rush through the game at breakneck speeds. A new season is already on its way with more coming this type of game is always a marathon not a race.
- it needs a way to just go into a dungeon without walking to it
....yes yes it does lol. This is legit criticism poe does this so well and it allows you to just go straight into the action after your last dungeon so here is hoping they figure this out.

There are other much smaller things like music being bad which I disagree with but that is heavily subjective and few others but yea Currently the game is solid its good. It has its problems a few odd balance issues that need ironed out but they have shown to be quickly working on that I mean 6 patches in a week mates they are working on the balance.

Assassin's Creed: Revelations,PlayStation 3,229,229,"The problem with Assassin's Creed games is that the fans are divided about the game-play. Some of them would like to see a bundle of new changes that they believe will ultimately make the game better, whilst another group simply want a few minor additions and clean ups but for the game-play to remain primarily the same. In my opinion, more additions and clean ups could have been implemented into the game, such as the annoying moments when Ezio seems to leap off in another direction to the one I actually wanted him to go in to be sorted, but I do not want a full revamp each time. This game remained a little too similar to the previous titles in combat and movement, and so those would be my negatives. My one and only other negative would be the story, as there aren't many obvious 'revelations' in the story, as none of my important questions were answers, and all that does remain in the repetitive storyline are a few weak explanations about some of the character's pasts. However, I have to say that Ubisoft have done fantastic work on Constantinople, and have made a new vibrant and beautiful city to observe and explore, which feels more alive than the previous games. On the whole, I would say that AC Revelations is a decent entry into an amazing franchise, but the story is too confusing and not interesting enough to attract any fans outside of the already established fan base.",7,2011-11-20,CursedKnight187,False

I never cared about the girl who wears the soulstone, now even more annoying, in this SHORT expansion even player character behaves and sounds like a little ****. I mean, you are fighting against the greatest unimaginable evil, and his voice and sentences are shockingly stupid. I guess to satisfy political correctness. Particles everywhere, lightshow, throbbing lights, attack speed so fast you can't even see animation, they have went even lower then Diablo 4 cartoony crap. The expansion is short, without any fascinating CGI cinematics, even the most in-game [which are very few] cinematics are worse and shorter.

Mephisto is a dog, Jesus later because woman has to win against patriarchy. How they could slip up so much, I don't know... I don't know... but they certainly don't know either.

Cons
-Lighting in some cutscenes are a bit awkward
-Notice in the first and last parts of the cutscene in Yen sid tower Riku doesn't have the blue stripes on his jacket
-Combat is still wonky in some areas meaning there is no combo modifiers
-Boss design (Except for mirror Aqua boss) are poorly desgined meaning the Demon Tower boss hits randomly and can never be staggered nor leave an opening.
-Your quite open after shocklock and spellweaver there are no invincible frames
-The camera can be a bit off at times especially at Auto-Lock-on because camera is close to Aqua's back
-Critical mode I don't like the idea of little MP and two hits= Dead thing especially since Aqua is a magic user
-Weird platforming
-Note:Some complain about the frequent frame-ratedrops and crashes on both JP and ENG
-Final boss is ridiculous hits you no matter what you do
-Lackluster checkpoints

Forza Motorsport 6,Xbox One,175,175,"Racing games have always had a niche market.
There are arcade racers like Need for Speed and party racers like Mario Kart. And don’t even get started on Rocket League, the year’s hottest new eSports game. But one thing keeps graphics-privy gamers coming back: simulation racers.
Enter Forza Motorsport 6, the — yeah, you guessed it — sixth installment in the famed racing series from Turn 10 Studios and Microsoft. While many consider a series at six tired and old, this year’s installment offers plenty to veterans of the series and newcomers looking for a sweet ride.
One new feature is the introduction of wet-weather driving, and it looks unbelievably gorgeous. The best part? It’s amazingly accurate, and reminds players that most of (looking at you North Texans) have no idea how to drive in inclement weather.
Cars skid and slide and hydroplane all over, and it offers a unique dynamic to a series that didn’t even have car damage at first.
Forza 6 has more than 450 cars, many of which were present in previous entries, but this is the most cars at launch yet.
Also back is the acclaimed “Forzavista” mode, which allows players to pick a car, place it in a showroom and step inside using the Xbox One Kinect. This mode features intense and picture-perfect detail that is just breathtaking. (Seriously, take a breath.)
The Top Gear partnership returns as well, sans its figureheads.
This game is packed to the hard-shell top with content. Tracks from all over the world are reproduced as stunning vistas. Damage is real and reactive. The cars screech and squeal around the tracks, and the Formula One cars might be the coolest things ever.
Still a problem though, is the game’s crowds. Obviously a car game doesn’t need to have photo-realistic people watching the races, but on a replay it may break immersion.
Multiplayer modes offer players even more replay value, as division races, leagues, rivals and more fill the playlists. Like to drift? There’s something for you. Like to race in teams? You got it.
Overall, Forza 6 offers a lot in its $60 asking price. While its sister series Forza Horizon takes the year off, players can enjoy sitting back, relaxing (unless you play stick shift) and revving their engines.
(Pro tip: this game supports those super expensive racing wheels.)

Borderlands 2,PC,726,500,"After having this game for a few years it's about time I write a review.

Borderlands 2 is one of those games that seems to do everything right.

Great story, amazing, diverse, interesting whacky characters and humour, so much to kill, quest and loot.
Even the enemies are diverse and interesting. So many different kinds of enemies, from the large variety of bandits that say all manner of things when fighting you and the strange alien animal enemies such as skags, bullymongs and many others.

No matter how many times I play this game I never get sick of it. Iam playing my third character and levelling her to max lvl and am still enjoying myself.

The game also has RPG elements such as you have various skill trees to put points in as well as can customise the look of your character by skins and heads, though most of the more interesting ones you have to pay for.

And you can try and do all the challenges if you do get bored which increases your badass rank, giving you tokens to put into increasing things like health, shield recharge rate etc. by a small .% of each token used, so it adds up and makes your character even stonger as you'll need it if you want to face terramorphous a very challenging lvl 52 super  boss.

There is not really any major downsides I can think of with this game, had no bugs or problems, the controls are good.

The only negatives I can think of is that I tend to out level quests, I end up lvl 19 and have a lvl 15 quest. And if you want the best loot you have to do a lot of boss farming.

This game I'd class as almost perfect in my top 5 of all time favourite games. This is a must play game.",9,2015-10-10,PrincessRose,False

Forza Horizon 4,PC,272,272,"First the good: beautiful, fun to drive (with a controller or with a wheel), lots of cars. And it runs really well on PC, surprisingly well. Driving around the world feels great. What's not to like? Well...

The single player progression is very badly-paced, and it feels a bit aimless too. In most games you begin from nothing and work your way up; in this game they just hand you lots of cool stuff at the start, and they don't really give you a direction. Just go do some events, build up your money and your ""influence"" to unlock more events. If you lose your races you still get both money and influence and the NPCs say ""Great job! Keep that up and you're gonna go far!"" What am I even doing in this game? I can go lose a race thirty times and buy a McLaren, but I'm not sure why I should want to.

The aimless and open-ended nature of the game extends to everything. Only want to race D-class cars? You can take your D-class to almost any event and it will just scale down the event to match your car. There is no reason to fill out your collection. The game will never force you to build that A-class RWD rally car to compete in an event, or whatever. No wonder other users call it repetitive and boring. A game needs to give players direction, it can't JUST be a sandbox.

On to the other problems:

- You can make custom races, but not time trial. Why not? Huge oversight. They tried removing it from FM7 and fans made a fuss until they brought it back, now it's gone again for Horizon 4. Are they stupid?

- Thankfully PC has FoV settings so you can tone down the default too-wide FoV, but it's hard-locked to 40 vertical FoV minimum, which is still too high for most setups. Even if you edit your settings in the text file to be lower, the game will not render lower than 40. Luckily I have a very large monitor which I can pull very close, but many do not. Getting this right makes driving feel much more 'real' and it's ridiculous that they arbitrarily prevent this.

- Many other irritating problems with settings. Menu sound effects and other ambient sound effects are not separate categories, so if you like to play with loud and immersive sounds the menus will be way too loud. No option for rearview on screen if you play in anything other than cockpit view. Etc.

But finally and most importantly, the online competitive racing which this game is supposed to be all about is bad. Driving alone feels great, but when you race other people they are all using overpowered AWD builds that plow you into corners. You can only have fun with the multiplayer racing if you have friends to organize a good clean race with. Good luck with that.

All in all, I am enjoying this game. But I cannot in good conscience give it a high score that it does not deserve. This game has so much potential, as they say. It is a shame because they have the resources to make a much larger and fuller game than any niche racing sim—this could have been a sim lite with excellent graphics and an engaging single-player campaign, but instead we have this mess, crippled by poor development choices.",6,2020-02-23,Oggranak,False

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,PC,307,307,"They did a great job sneaking the overused Far Cry engine and gameplay into this. I was very skeptical that they can pull it off. 
Aside from the cringe human-NPC animations and most voice acting, the game is an 8.5/10 for me. On the road to 9/10 with proper patches and content.
Collectibles are on edge to be annoying. 
Tier-system on gear is dumb, 2 and not 3 would've been enough.
Not to speak of some dumb stats on gear like stealth/stealth damage, riding damage, melee damage-reduction (when there is literally no melee weapon in the game, you'll always fight from distance). 
Some stats are not even explained, while other “buffs” on gear are straight up garbage. 
I went for weakness-spot damage, flat % damage, some range damage reduction/health if the other 2 weren't possible and had no issues whatsoever with the game on highest difficulty with not even using food for buffs.
The hardest boss was the inventory & storage limit and the master chef achievement, which can't even be completed.
The Game looks good and usually runs fine on my 3090 + 10900k with maxed (except upscaling) settings @1440p, DLSS balanced.
Occasional FPS drops (from locked 65 sometimes down to 4x) in some regions with far sight or random scenarios + weather effects.

Destiny: The Dark Below,PlayStation 4,97,97,"uggh. I was really hoping Bungie was going to redeem themselves with this DLC and full fill the IPs true potential. Or at least head in that direction.  Nope.  That is not happening with dark below. In fact they somehow made it  worse.... And this is just DLC not an expansion, lets not get it twisted.  Expensive DLC at that.   There is literally only about 1 hours worth of NEW content.    And to make crap worse, they locked out some of the game, like yesterday's daily mission to people who didn't buy the **** now I can't play even the most basic of missions with friends who didn't get the DLC.  Playing with friends was one of the best parts of the game, now that seems to be diminished some unless you pay them more money. .
And it gets worse.  Despite the mass amount of complaints from the shrinking group of supporters, Bungie still stubbornly refuses to add matchmaking to the RAIDs.  Either that's an excuse not to spend the money on **** they are straight up liars and have no intention of listening to the community...aside from the Crucible the RAIDs are the only reason to play the game.  Say good bye to any casuals....
Bungie is listening to their community pretty terribly if their response to a highly requested feature is stubbornly turned down.  Only a small niche of players who like grinding are going to be pleased with this DLC.  And looking at the reviews that seems to be the case.  Less then 10% of the reviews are favourable.
I gave Destiny an 8 despite its short comings when it came out, in the belief there would be more story once the Expansions started to come out.  NOPE! This new DLC should have been free to begin with considering the poor reviews with the initial launch.   If the next DLC isn't FREE, there is zero chance I will be playing Destiny in the foreseeable future.   And zero chance I will be purchasing Destiny 2, no matter how good it is.  Now its a matter of PRINCIPAL.

This would have been received better if there was a PC version, as PC players tend to like grinding more. BUT NO, no mention of an any PC version down the road either.

ELEX II,PC,60,60,"This is the first time I've ever not recommended a PB RPG. It hurts to say that because I've been a big fan of their games since I first played Gothic 1 and 2 when Gothic 2 first hit shelves in North America. I've been playing their games since and apart from a few moments where they've come close to Gothic 1 and 2 (Risen 1), it's been a slow steady decline. This decline was barely acceptable with Elex but Elex 2 hits a new low that I cannot support in any way. This is not just one of the worst games PB has ever made, it's one of the worst games I have ever played. The combat is juvenile, the graphics are buggy (and recycled from Elex), as is the music (most of it from Elex 1) and terrible (an insult to anything Kai Rosenkrantz ever did). The writing is some of the worst I've ever encountered. The quests make almost no sense. Factions don't make any rational sense (why would anybody join the Morkons?) and things that people say make little to no sense. The entire script sounds like it was translated from German to English using Google Translate, then passed to mostly bad voice actors with no coaching or guidance on emphasis, cadence, tone, or pronunciation. Some characters from the first game are retconed, yet new characters are brought in and you are expected to believe you played with in the first game (ie. Bully). Companions are abusive (ie. Nasty, Bully, etc.) for seemingly no reason. You have a child, who you and your partner treat like garbage (this can't have been written by a parent), especially at the end of the game. This is genuinely embarrassing to see from PB. I will be stunned if these developers manage to get funding for Elex 3 and even more stunned if I can be convinced to play it. I am stupider for having played this game. And for people that say ""they're a small studio of 30+ people"", enough. It's been over two decades since Gothic 2.

I have never left a review for a game before but Battlefield 2042 is so infuriating that I created a Metacritic account so I could shout into the void about how much I hate this game.  I have played every Battlefield since 1942, that is nearly 20 years worth of titles, and I have never been so frustrated with an FPS game in my life.  Even for a BF game, the maps are too open and filled with wasted space that you are expected to run across and hope that you don't get picked off along the way.  The spawn points have a great tendency to put you in the line of sight of the opposing team so good luck even getting to the point where you sprint for your life.  I have had little time to even try and learn the maps because you are constantly being overrun (by what I assume are mostly bots) so early stages of the game are a steady mix of dying and waiting for respawn.  The UI is confusing poorly laid out at all levles and the fact that you have multiple operators but only 4 loadouts is baffling. It is clear that they deliberately did not include a scorecard for matches because they don't want you to actually see how poorly you are doing in each and every match.  The fact that they give you 10,000 XP for playing your first match of the game is further proof that they are begging you to come back and play again the next day.",0,2021-12-14,asharp7,False

Control,PC,423,423,I have very mixed  feelings about this game.Half of them are positive and the other is negative.Firstly i will start off by  saying that this game is 80% inspired  from the scp **** altered items(Scp's) the bureau (SCP foundation) and everything else.That for me is a positive since i loved the SCP foundation before they ruined **** that doesn't mean that the game doesn't have its own **** does and i did like some parts of it but most of the story was pretty standard and 60% **** had some good and interesting parts but they were too few and far **** characters were alright the VA of the main heroine was  in my opinion really bad and i didn't felt any  hint of emotion  when she spoke.Darling on the other hand was  **** amazing.I loved every scene when he showed up even made me wonder if this guy was a professional actor or something since he was really good at acting  and every time i watched him he seemed super entertained in what he was **** Bless that **** other characters are your standard sub-human trash with no unique perks or personality .Gameplay wise  60% of it i **** mechanics and power-ups you get are pretty good (except the levitation part which was really badly **** enemies were pretty standard with barely anything unique in them.I loved reading the summaries of the altered objects(SCPs) but that's because i love stuff like **** ending was ok nothing special really  it looked more like it was made to sell the game's future DLC which i will not be buying.Music was good especially when the soundtrack started playing in the trippy Ashtray **** i loved that part it was soooo goood  with all the moving rooms and doors and awesome music loved every bit of that part.Overall it's an alright game and if you are an SCP fan this is probably the closest you will get to an SCP game so you better check it out.-1 because they decided to be greedy and go Epic store Exclusive.Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,7,2019-12-29,BulgarianCritic,False

D2 Resurrected is just D2 HD edition with new graphics. And also, have you tried playing D2 last year? No one played. The remastered edition has breathed fresh air into the game which will keep it alive for a few years longer and that is great because D2 is a great game.

I don't know what ppl were expecting... D4? Go play that when it comes out. This is only D2 as advertised and it plays great, works great, graphics look awesome and also you can switch between legacy and modern graphic with the touch of a button. I guess ppl are butthurt cuz they have to pay a little bit (40 pounds is a little steep but for a legendary game like D2 it's worth it as it's one of the best games that ever came out)

As the game progresses, the Messenger gains new abilities such as climbing walls, gliding in the air, long-range shuriken attacks, and using a grappling hook to propel himself through obstacles and enemies.

Bulletstorm,PC,197,197,"I am having some bombastic ceinamatic fun at the moment with Bulletstorm. The game has no depth but that's the point. And they have so much fun with it. And to add insult to injury for everyone who takes shooters too seriously, this is probably the most competent shooting I ever experienced. It sure beats borderlands 2, bioshock 1, Crysis 2 and Metro 2033, Rage. I still find Half Life's 2 shooting phenominal though, tight and responsive and I really enjoy the shooting of Bioshock 2 and Infinite (which is very similar from one another) so lets say its on par for the shooting aspect as it is with the Darkness 2 which it shares a lot with. Its creative and colourful too and bombastic, just the way I like it. I really liked doing combos in Bioshock Infinite, Madworld and Darkness 2, so what I am given here is perfect. I also like how there are different approaches to enemy types. My favourite weapon is the shotgun and the grenade chain, I like how they offer great combos, which is something the sniper rifle doesnt have (though this is a great sniper rifle too). I like how the game works beyond the mechanics of a shooter. Ammo and upgrades are determined by your skill. You can go through the game with your assault rifle, but being creative offers even more opportunities to be creative and helps you not run out of ammo either. I love how the game had a simple plan in mind and executed it with such style. I do find it far too linear to the point where it feels like an on rails shooter at times (which it actually becomes a few times through the game), but that just makes me appreciate other games which others might beleive to be too linear like the Bioshock and Dead Space games.

And oddly enough, another shooter this reminds me of, for art style and pace is Spec Ops the Line (although the Darkness 2 is its closest gameplay cousin). Yeah, bet you didnt see that coming. They are actually very very similar in the way the story and goals function. Its a ravaged city that was once vibrant and the bright colours of the interiors contrast with the yellow sand and ruins. Your goal is to get to a military figure and you have to brav through the hoards to get there. It feels direct and purposeful which is great because the whole point of the game was to make fun of some of these aspects of other games and it came before Spec Ops! (both also have a helicopter turret section although one has a dinosaur in that scene as well).",9,2013-12-31,william-james88,False

Mad Max,Xbox One,92,92,"This game suffers from what seems to be a growing trend among new games.  It just wasn't ready when released.  It's very buggy.  1.  Sometimes if you die, the game cannot load you back in.  I actually have to reboot the xbox in order for the game to work again and it usually puts me at an old save point.  I tried to combat this with saving the game myself, but to no avail.  2.  The camera angles are the worst.  When driving and it's a MAJOR portion of the game, the camera has a mind of it's own.  When you need to look forward, the camera thinks you need to look at the left rear corner panel or off to the side somewhere.  This also applies to hand to hand combat.  You lose sight of some enemies, only to be blindsided by a **** punch from an enemy you cannot see 3.  Cars just disappear.  You need to take enemy cars back to a safehouse to add them to your collection.  I've left a car to drive another one and came back and it's gone.  Where did it go?  I also had one disappear on me while i was running to get into it.  4.  Inconsistencies all around.  Sometimes Max can fall off a significant mountain top and just tumble and roll with no death, other times Max can fall off a 6ft ledge onto soft desert sand and be dead.  5.  Repetitive.  Same tasks over and over drive here, get this, pick up scrap, race and repeat.  Dialog is also repetitive..everytime Max gets out of the Magnum Opus, he has to tell Chumbucket to stay with the car.  And why do we fear the mighty duster so much?  It does NOTHING.  6.  Archangels.  The serve absolutely NO purpose.  You can pick your own car body and with scrap and leveling up, can make your car better, faster and stronger than any stupid Archangel.

Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright,3DS,81,81,"Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is a worthy followup to the critically acclaimed Fire Emblem Awakening. Like Awakening Birthright is accessible for new players as well as offering familiar options like permadeath for older fans. The game has a number of difficulty settings consisting of casual, normal, or hard. It also has variations to further augment the difficulty. Phoenix Mode revives allies instantly. In Classic mode if your ally falls they are gone for good. Then there is Lunatic mode which is incredibly punishing.

Phoenix mode feels designed for those that want to enjoy the story while the other modes will appeal to series vets and purists. For those that want a challenge I recommend starting on Hard difficulty. Normal is still a bit too easy and your units will feel pretty overpowered early on even if you are playing on classic mode.

It needs to be said that FE:Fate's presentation is top notch. The cutscenes and character animations are well done. The character models themselves actually have feet! In areas like my castle you can tap the L shoulder button to zoom down and see your surroundings in 3rd person. In battle the camera shifts from top down to also zoom in on your surrounding terrain.

Birthright's story can be best described as standing with your family the Hoshido against the Nohr empire. Conquest on the other hand has you siding with Nohr. But as any Fire Emblem vet can tell you; its a bit more nuanced than that. Birthright and Conquest essentially start the same. At mission 5 you will then branch off into that version's storyline. Birthright is the easier more accessible version. It allows you to grind and fight random battles to build up your party.

Fates introduces some new mechanics that shake up some classic Fire Emblem staples. Weapons no longer take durability damage (aside from staves and rods). The map can be altered using what are called Dragon veins. These spots can create bridges, level mountains and more.

The game also introduces a new area called My Castle. You can build buildings such as shops, mess hall, fishing pond and more. These often offer items that you can use in a number of ways. In my castle you can also invite party members to your private quarters to boost your relationship. The dating sim elements of Awakening have been expanded here in that once you marry you will have new options within your private quarters. You may also have to use the stylus to wake your significant other for instance.

My castle also has a little bit of online multiplayer in it that allows you to siege other player's castles and defend your own as well.

Its advisable to play Birthright first followed by Conquest and then Revelation. Buying physical copies of both is essentially a waste of money because you get the others at a cheaper price as a download once you own one version.

Overall Birthright is excellent part in one of the most expansive Fire Emblem tales to date.",9,2016-08-07,Lone_Wolf_Sones,False

Watch Dogs,Xbox 360,83,83,"A very disappointing offering from usually Stellar Ubisoft.

The graphics were quite sub par, especially when Rockstar showed what could be accomplished in GTAV. At times I was wondering if I was looking at polygonal textures on a PS1 when I saw some trees and buildings. The sound design was good and their were a few good musical tracks but the majority were dull. The cycling through each one to find a song you liked was painful and time consuming. All these things could have been forgiven with decent gameplay and alot of variety in missions. However, the gameplay left rough and buggy and missions had you doing the same hack-shoot-escape dynamic that really took away from the fun.

Watchdogs has a great deal of potential to be something great, but much of it is lost in the glaring flaws of the game. Comparing this to GTAV is overdone, but its only because Rockstar had polished their world to a level of masterful perfection while Watchdogs feels like a pre-alpha test run.

Predator: Hunting Grounds,PlayStation 4,115,115,"My Dad got this game and honestly it is great but is missing key components for what a predator game should be. I feel single player was needed, I just want to mess some AI up as the Predator with so many things to use against them. The controls are pretty good not a lot to say about them. There are many bugs/glitches one of them being when I got to customize my character and I go to see what I unlocked I hover over it and boom there is the skin I got. Then I back out it still says that I still haven't looked at it. The gunplay is decent like there is no recoil which bothers me. When I got this thing called a ""Field Locker"" I was like ok what is this and since I got after leveling up I though it was increased storage for stuff I have unlocked kinda like Minecraft of PUBG too an extent but no it was some stupid ass lootboxes why do game companies rely on stupid business practices but the good thing is it is ONLY cosmetic and you can buy them with in game currency and you earn in game without buying with real world money which is good but get rid of these ok. They should do something like COD with milestones. The predator itself is awesome to see as a Fireteam player, but when being attacked your guns do literally nothing to it. You should get 3 custom class options instead of one, the leveling in this game for unlocks is absurd. Level 100 just for a classic vest like I'm going to be playing this game for that long.

SteamWorld Dig 2,Nintendo Switch,94,94,"Get ready for an axe picking good time!

Rusty, the protagonist from Steamworld Dig one, has gone missing and you play as the fembot Dot whose mission it is to track him down.  Equipped with only her trusty pick axe, you begin building your tool kit of gadgets by yep, you guessed it digging.  Just like it’s predecessor, you dig your own path through the randomly generated per play through mine.  Where you collect resources to sell in order to upgrade your gear.  Throughout the game you earn more advanced gear that is also upgradable, therein lies the loop.  Diving into the deep dark depths of the mine, collecting as much ore as you can carry, before your light runs out, only to make it to the top and come back more powerful than before, is such an addictive gameplay experience that it’s easy to lose track of time while doing it.

Each new section of the world is built specific to your most recently aquired tool, layering skill upon skill, think 2d zelda style, and yes there’s a hook shot.  One moment you're grappling your way across a barren windy desert and the next you're animating molten iron giants with your ignition axe.  Every inch of this world so cleverly designed combined with the fact that you dig your own path , it feels like it was designed just for you. Rewarding you with intuitively hidden secrets and just the right amount of difficulty for the perfect challenge. (desert clip, molten robot, button hook shot puzzle shot)

Steamworld dig two has a lovely cast of characters with a variety ranging from goofy/crazy to prejudicial. The mayor of the town for example, warns you of the shiners, the crazies that live down deep in the mine, well once you get here they're just lovely and help you wholeheartedly . It's amazing that even though I'm a fembot mining my way through this fictitious underground, some things ring real and true.

A very welcome change from the original are the boss fights.  Throughout the game you will encounter many different boss fights, which are a great combination of level design and enemy attack pattern maneuvering.  With your different mechanics that you acquire throughout the game, you have multiple options for defeating every enemy.  Stick that mine roach with a hydrobomb, or shove that fire demon into a pool of water, the choice is yours.

Another upgrade is the length of the game. While steamworld dig one was on the shorter side depending on your play style steamworld dig two can take you well over ten hours to complete. Especially if you like to get your hands dirty.

For a 2d open world, metroidvania experience, steamworld 2 will deliver in every single way.  Some metroidvanias leave me frustrated searching for ways to open the next section of the world but in steamworld 2, taking a wrong turn and getting lost on some random self imposed agenda is half the fun.

Whether it's a great movie, a book, or a video game.  It’s rare that a sequel can perfectly capture the same lightning in a bottle as the original while elevating the franchise to the next level.  Well steamworld dig 2 has done just that.

With an engaging world, rock solid mechanics, and a gameplay loop that will keep you digging for more.

Yes, the game play is grindy.  But for a game based on the premise of you being a mercenary searching for treasure on an alien planet that was sparsely inhabited, what more do you expect?  Still, the missions require more than standing around shooting at things and the frenzy at which they throw things at you in different ways require that you change things up or die.  Also, the weapons create a different play style based on who you are playing and what you find.  If you find a gun that is really accurate and has a really  high firing rate, it completely changes what skills you put your points into and how you play as opposed to finding a power house that blows people away but takes a long time between shots.

You can here the zombies running behind you and it feels like the really are just a few feet behind you and the screams some of them make can sometimes put a shiver down your spine.

BattleTech,PC,136,136,"When the game works, and it does, sometimes - it's a thrill, with visceral combat full of interesting tactical options and small (5-10) but fairly varied roster of mission types & maps. Weapons have a weight to them and it's incredibly satisfying to bring an enemy mech down. The mercenary tactial/command portion (which you need to get through an hour or two of middling intro gameplay and story exposition to reach) is great, with much more depth than is explained by the tutorials. Watching your c-bills drain and deciding whether to jump in to a contract and risk losing a pilot or wait until repairs are done and field a stronger lance give some gravity to your command decisions as bankruptcy can be just around the corner.

When it doesn't work, though - you'll find:
-  GPU-melting bad optimization which has already destroyed people's graphic cards - a unity game is running GTX1080s at 100% load?
- progress wiped by corrupted saves
- strange graphical glitches (screen-wide motion blur when selecting a specific mech, weapons and mechs clipping through the environment, screen going dark/bright )
- LONG load times (regardless of pc spec)
- odd unit behaviour (walking backwards to a point and then abrubtly swivelling instead of turning while walking, melee attacks not actually connecting)

To add to the overall feeling of mediocrity are bland controls, odd ball weapons that don't work as advertised and a lack of relevant scenario's that leaves this game feeling more like a watered down WWII version of Hitman but not in a good way.

Mass Effect: Andromeda,PC,1282,500,"ME:A is a long game, it has a whole lot of content and expect around 50-60 hours of playtime for a playthrough. I am just 18 hours in and Im still only at ~20%. The game looks absolutely beautiful at times, the planets and scenery are great. When it comes to the game's looks it has gotten a lot of stick for its animations and faces. Unfortunately the critique has turned into nothing less than a hate train.

The facial animations are sub-par, that much is true. But the game looks and plays amazing otherwise! I don't understand people. ""Let's hate on something, call it a complete failure and trash **** just over one thing!""﻿. If you ask me it's their loss.

The game pays a lot of homage to Mass Effect 1, the first game in the Original trilogy and you can feel that this is still a Mass Effect game, even without our beloved Commander Shepard. It's a great game on its own, it has its issues but in the long run its nothing that takes away from the overall experience, which is a good experience.

The combat gameplay is what really shines through, the fluid animations here are great and presents very enjoyable fights against foes. I also like how they've made it possible for the players to form their own kind of classes by mixing powers, it invites you to try new and different things out and that in turn leads to replayability value. The Multiplayer is pretty fun, but not much has changed from ME3. It's like a very improved version of the mp that we had in ME3, and with the new combat gameplay it's a whole lot more fun. The new mobility invites for new types of combat aswell.

If you love sci-fi then you will enjoy this game, BioWare may not know how to animate faces properly, but they do know how to build immersive and interesting worlds. Epic game that I'd give 8/10, but since I've seen firsthand the kind of undeserved hate it is getting because it's somehow popular now to hate on BioWare and ME, I will give it a 10.

Battlefield 3,PC,1627,500,"My biggest problem with the game is that the map design is really bad, it's obvious none of the maps were designed for 64 players, because every map packs players into a tiny area with 3-5 capture points and then funnels every player through unavoidable chokepoints filled with snipers and tanks and men running around with knives.  They've removed all the tactical gameplay that made Battlefields 1942/2/2142 so great, the game turns into a mindless grind with no balance or thought.  Some of the maps are better than others, but there are 4 or 5 out of the 9 that come with the game that are up with the worst from Bad Company 2, which was a sort of mini-console-Battlefield that Battlefield 3 wasn't supposed to be emulating.  Like, two of the nine Battlefield 3 maps are literally linear underground tunnels.  I was extremely disappointed that there isn't a single large-scale map up there with even the mid-sized maps from the old Battlefield games.  If you look at the promo videos which pretty much all involve flying jets (which have no effect on the rest of the game by the way, they're in the game mostly for looks and bullet points I think) the maps look pretty large but all of the capture points are clustered in one tiny area which turns the game into another Call of Duty.  They seem to have focused much more on adding a bunch of annoying leveling features, you start out with nothing and then have to grind your way up to get more gear, eventually you'll unlock weapons like an IR Scope that's basically a dev-endorsed wall-hack or gun addons that remove all of your recoil.  There are some really huge oversights like air vehicles not starting out with countermeasures, which means as soon as you take off you'll be shot down by one of the 12 players on the other team wielding missile launchers, until you grind enough to unlock something to defend yourself.  Nothing in this game is about being ""fun"", it's about being addictive and fulfilling a lot of soulless corporate metrics.  Who cares if the game plays like crap, if you can compel players to grind out a bunch of silly awards?  If you're reading this review 3 months from now, you should probably just avoid, because I suspect it will be really miserable to start out in this game once you're going up against teams of experienced players with leveled upped gear.  I only tried single player for about 2 minutes, within that time I shot a few AK-47 wielding masked terrists and QTE'd a man to death and then QTE jumped from an exploding train, which is way too many QTE's for me.  If you like games that try to look like action movies I think you'll really enjoy this one though.  The only positives I can think of are that the graphics and sound are very nice.  I'm still holding out hope there will be some sort of additional maps or expansion or something that fixes some of the problems, but I really doubt it based on what I've seen so far, Battlefield 3 has already sold like a hojillion copies so I do not think Electronic Arts gives a ****",3,2011-10-31,tbasht,False
NieR: Automata,PlayStation 4,936,500,"Nier Automata was a masterpiece. Yoko Taro did it in my book, the game may not be for everyone but is sure as hell for me. Some may say the Combat was repetitive and in a way it is but only if you limit yourself to the same weapon types. Some also say that the game lacks originality and doesn't imply new mechanics, I mean if it ain't broke why fix it, sure they may not have implemented new mechanics but they sure as hell did a good job the chip system was also great though not explained very well (Chips with a diamond means its the lowest possible Cost it can be, keep that in mind, Don't use the Offensive heal Chips as it makes the game too easy just my preference) but the further you play the more you'll understand. Difficulty wise i think playing on Normal mode is too easy and playing on Hard is probably the best way to play.

Story 10/10 Story really reels you in the more you play it making more complex along the way. Completing side quests also adds to the lore of the overall game though its not necessary its a good way to fill some plot holes from the main story

Gameplay 9/10 Sidequests are a chore and repetitive are what some negative reviews say and in a way they are, BUT and a big but like i said earlier sidequests add to the lore and if you're interested in the lore like i was it becomes less tedious and more exciting as you unravel the stories behind some of the sidequests. Combat wise its a normal hack and slash game that makes it interesting with the combination of weapons for new combos, the bullethell parts which i loved and the 2d, 3d, Top view parts are absolutely fantastic.

Graphics 10/10 graphics were phenomenal and really captured the post apocalyptic feel of the game destroyed buildings, reclaimed areas, broken cars all the little details really add up to the total scenery of the game.

Characters 9/10 I absolutely love the protagonists of the game and were in a way even emotionally invested in them some scenes gave me goosebumps some made me shed a tear some made blow air out of my nose more than usual, but in all seriousness the character development and relationships and interactions between characters really gives the game a lot of points from me. Though the only thing keeping me from giving it that one is the enemies its not as diverse as i'd like it to be they all look somewhat the same though some have different weapons its always better to have a wider variety of looks for regular mobs. All bosses were awesome though.

Sorry if this was a bad review, this was my first one and i actually made a metacritic account just to make this review. I was that in love with the  game that i just had to give it my personal opinions. I don't know if everyone will like it but YOU! yes YOU the one reading this you should cast all doubt aside and buy this. In all honesty i didn't expect a lot from this game was just interested from a post i saw somewhere that you can play a goth Loli with bad ass swrods, i though why not and bought the game thinking its just gonna be some generic Hack and slasher game, but in the end i just shot past my most favorite games of all time up there with the witcher 3 and Last of Us.

Characters and dialogues make me cringe most of the time and graphics are nothing to write home about. Ubisoft finally got rid of the damn towers in the game, but the gameplay is still somewhat repetitive after just a few hours.

For starters there are no new levels or locations to explore, also there are no new gameplay mechanics or gameplay improvements. The soundtrack is the same with no new tracks or remakes, no new puzzles or items were added.

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree,Xbox Series X,54,54,"It's good. A solid DLC and well worth buying if you loved Elden Ring. The combat and art of the game is still s-tier. The difficulty is spot on (no, it's not too hard, even before the nerf). The bosses are mostly fun. And here's the first negative: none of the new bosses gave me a fight that was particularly memorable. Some have interesting mechanics to negotiate, but nothing that rivaled what's in the base game. I also found the open world empty much of the time. You'd walk or ride around and see, fight and find nothing except sheep. They could have halved the size of the map and it wouldn't have affected the game whatsoever. And FromSoft still haven't sorted how the execute NPC quests in an open world context. It's not a deal-breaker but it's a frustration. Related to this is the DLC leveling mechanic. It creates an unnecessary complication particularly when it comes to navigating around the map. The entire region should have the same difficulty. Okay, this may seem like it's a harsh review, but rest assured I really enjoyed my time in the Shadows.

The bolt stream is totally awesome as its like a machine gun but the scythe bolt pales in comparison.

I was a little bummed about the music in the second infamous game. The music was so great in the first game but I barely heard any memorable melodies in the sequel. The motion-capture cutscenes are a welcome addition to the comic book style ones. The characters have great depth and interesting personalities.

SMITE,PC,270,270,"I played a lot of LoL and some DOTA 2, and this game is very, very similar in terms of mechanics and gameplay. The view and lack of auto attack (every auto attack is actually a skill shot) is enough to totally set this game apart though.
It feels slower than LoL and easier to pick up and play as a noob. The gold difference between someone that's dominating and someone that's getting owned is much smaller than in LoL. It's therefore much harder to snowball, and any advantage gained in early lane is quickly caught up.
One of the hardest things to get used to is running from a battle with low health, having to turn your back on the action. With LoL obviously you can see the action even when running away. In Smite you can only see what's in front. You may turn around and run because of low health, only to have a look back and find that your team has won the battle after all.
I play this game at 2560 x 1600 max settings and it looks wonderful and it's perfectly smooth on Xfire 290x cards.
There is no chat to all in this game, only your own team. Somehow between this and the fact that you're using WASD to move, the chat in game is minimal and much less agro than LoL.
Pros
- Good tutorials and good learning curve
- Looks great and is very smooth with pretty much 0 lag
- Much much MUCH less flaming / agro / abuse than LoL and far fewer trolls
- Less snowballing and domination from an early game advantage

Cons
- Doesn't quite feel as addictive as LoL
- Hard to learn a whole new set of champions and spells

IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad,PC,174,174,"This review would look very different if I wrote it a year ago.
The game came was released in barebones status but a lot of work was put into it since then. You can even say that it received multiple upgrades, all free. There have been some mistakes however, though most of them were changed or are oficially announced to be changed. Still, it is immediately recognizable that people who made this game are experienced combat flight sim creators.

Now I want to make it as short as possible so I`ll just say that the single best thing in the game is the aircraft and the feeling of flight. In those terms Battle of Stalingrad is a true successor to IL2 Sturmovik. When you fly`em you really get the ‘nextgen’ impression, even if the game is still in Dx9 (soon to be Dx11).

**** look great, especially bomber interiors deserve a commendation. I very much like the flight model. Each and every flyable aircraft flies different, for example you easily can tell the 109F4 and 109G2 apart. There are some design flaws but nothing your average sim pilot could get crazy about.
I also very much like the concept of custom loadouts, meaning that every plane has some field mods available (different windshield, added outer wing cannons, different types of gun in the propeller hub etc.).

Damage model is standard stuff I suppose, nothing really new here. Though be sure that even the smallest caliber rounds can break a plane if struck the sweet spot. It is entirely possible to blow off a part of a wing, disable weaponry or wound (kill) one of the crew members.
Engine management is not exactly state of the art. Again, I would describe it as a standard in such games. Change prop pitch/RPM, manage throttle and supercharger. What is questionable is that all engines have the same 1 minute overrev limitation whereas in real life some planes obviously had more or less durable engines and could go well above factory specs (the P40 for instance).

The weakest part of the title is the multiplayer. There is no coop mode available to date, mostly you just have to fly in a open map on a free hunt. It is possible to setup organized missions though it is faaaaaar too much hassle to do and needs serious streamlining. Still a work in progress though.

The graphics and sounds are good, at times very good. It has to be noted that it was a conscious development decision in order to make the game friendly for low spec PCs.

Also the dev team has finally removed options that had to be unlocked through grinding and that is a big plus.

8/10 from me.

Pros :
- engaging and challenging flight model
- damage model
- engine management
- graphics
- sounds
- detailed maps
- user interface
- compatibility and low spec accessibility

Cons :
- lackluster multiplayer
- limited and repetitive single player
- bad AI
- Dx9 and other game engine limitations
- some minor flight model quirks.",8,2016-08-17,MustisTheCat,False

Valorant,PC,2050,500,"It's true, the expectations about this game were very high. I refused to watch any gameplay video before I could play the game myself, because i wanted it to be a surprise and I trusted Riot for being LOL's developers, but now I can say it:

Valorant is the worst game I've ever played, and I've been playing a lot of games for 20 years now.

REASON 1: BORING
The game feels very boring, there's no variety at all, it's always the same ""Seek & Destroy"" mode, if you keep loosing at the start of each round you're spending 15-30 minutes watching other people playing.
A game of this genre is supposed to be fun, to entertain you, if I wanted to watch other people playing for 30 minutes while I do nothing, I'd go to twitch or youtube.

REASON 2: CLONE
Really, what's new about this game? Why should I play this game instead of other VERY similar games?
CS:GO, Overwatch, Paladins are examples. These 3 games are totally enjoyable, more competitive and well designed.
Valorant is the total opposite.

REASON 3: GAME MECHANICS ****
Player controls feel very slow, a lot of agents' skills are absolutely useless, trying to shoot is a total pain, the double firing system (normal fire for RMB and alternate fire for LMB) is totally confusing, there are way TOO MANY controls, and most of them are totally useless.
Really, playing Seek & Destroy mode on the worst Call Of Duty ever made would be a lot funnier than playing Valorant.
There are few weapons, and most of them feel totally the same. I tried to play many times different weapons, and they just feel like crap. Some of them are just too slow, you don't have time to react to enemy players, some of them are just the same as others, some are totally useless and unplayable.

REASON 4: WHY RELEASING IT?
I really don't understand how can people enjoy a game like this. This game feels just like a waste of time, each match I started I wished it would end immediately because it's totally boring since the first second of gameplay already.
Why did Riot released an unbalanced, incomplete, boring game like this?
I could have agreed on releasing a game this soon if it was a revolutionary idea they wanted to show to the world. But now that I tried the game I can say I'll go back to Overwatch/Paladins if I want to play a game of this genre.
It just feels like the only one that spent time working on this game was Riot's graphic department.
Regarding the rest of the game, I alone could have developed the code of this boring game in just a month.

I'm confident that Riot will make its best to improve this game, but it feels to me that it will take a loooong time.
This game is very far from an enjoyable game.

Yet again M+ is both required for raiding and taking it seriously requires mythic raiding which is an extreme time commitment. This is like if Blizzard made you play WC3 matches to be able to play Hearthstone.

Sleeping Dogs,PlayStation 3,142,142,"This is a wonderful game! It is much more realistic compared to GTA IV! The storyline is fabulous and this time the characters are credible. The atmosphere is awesome, Hong Kong looks amazing and the missions are alternately. Driving is very smooth and shooting has a great, raw sound. There are different side characters who have a credible personality. A bad thing about it is the fact it is at some points an exact copy of GTA, sometimes i got the feeling the were too lazy to make some small changes. Like when you drive someone to somewhere. At one moment they say: ''OMG WHAT ARE YOU DOING'' and the other moment they continue their scripted conversation, even if the car is spinning a 100 times around They were also too lazy to make a slightly different health bar, other place to put the mini map and so on. Other very good things are the ability to hijack cars when driving, to ram other vehicles, to shoot in slow motion while driving and not to mention the extensive combat system with a lot of upgrade possibilities. It is also great you gain more respect when the story goes on, which is a great role play element, just like the police upgradeds.

Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,PC,347,347,"This game is even worse than ""Remember Me"" or Deus Ex. It's filled with endless cutscenes full of nonsense dialogue and a bunch of nonsense lore. The character can't sprint, only jog slowly so getting around is a chore. There's no map and the puzzles are the worst I have seen in a game. You just walk around trying to line up runes at certain spots. Worse, the scenery isn't all stationary. Some of it is ""illusionary"", so walking to a certain spot or through a certain gate makes things appear or disappear. It's bleak, boring and doesn't make any sense. Plus, it's filled with ""psychosis"" and the character hears voices all the way through. You may as well have psychosis for real. That would be more enjoyable. The fighting isn't fair, and there is perma-death so you might have to start the game all over again if you die too many times. This one isn't worth it on sale. It's not even worth pirating for free. It's garbage on your drive. I got half way through and my frame rate dropped below 30 fps and that was the last straw. I uninstalled it. The game has bugs as well. A game of similar ""stature"" might well be ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"". I'd rate that one an 8/10. This one gets a zero. It just drags on and on and there's no way of skipping the morbid cut scenes. I guess it's filled with Norse mythology but it comes across as confusion. This one is a slog with zero fun.

Some more freedom to move around the city (instead of predetermined paths) would be great, along with better game design, which would enable my PC to run the game smoothly, without editing the .ini files all the time.

Far Cry 3,PlayStation 3,263,263,"If you've played Walking Dead or tried to play some expansions for Bethesda games you know what lag can do to a game, well this game has the same problems. This alone should scare you off, but there is more.

I bought this game for two reasons

Multiplayer with map editor. Are you ready for this? You cannot take your created maps and make a lobby with multiple maps. Even if you make a lobby with your one map, nobody will show up. You can leave it sit there for ten minutes and your name will be the only one. What is the point of making a map no one will ever play, including yourself. They also have some **** register bullcrap to make sure everyone pays for it. Now ask yourself why less than 1000 people are playing the multiplayer at any given time, I'll tell you why, because it is unpolished, controls are wonky and the maps created by people who are paid to design maps are awful.

The other reason I bought it was because I read it has survival aspects, being mgs3 was one of my favorite games I figured hell yeah. Well got some bad news there as well. You don't kill things for meat, you kill things for skin to make stupid **** so you can actually carry enough ammo to take out a group of three people. And of course you need specific animal skin for specific items.  You also get to pick some herbs, and the map shows you exactly where they are, along with all the ""hidden"" relics, of course you could just not unlock the radio tower that opens the map but then you would not know where the bad guys bases were. What do you get to do with these herbs? If you guessed make potions that you inject with a syringe you are right, which means you are as stupid as the game creators. Congrats! Just don't accidently pull out your C4 everytime you try to use anything like I do.

Other problems, limited loot and yet there is no chest in the safe house! Saving every minute so that you don't lose all the **** you crafted, because god knows upgrades don't warrant an autosave. Cliche acting that is neither so bad its good, or good. Driving that makes Grand Theft Auto 4 look like Burnout, with of course get from A to B in the allotted time or kids will die without their meds. Little do they know getting anywhere in the game on the ATV is so great a challenge the time limit was completely unnecessary. This game as many of late has the 30 minute intro that is set in stone so don't go outside the mission zone. Did I mention a camera that as far as I can tell doesn't take pictures nor dispense candy.

Basically this is another Mercenaries 2 game that you will get bored with first day and never play again. Warning this game has RPG elements which forces you to play the game to gain xp so that you can actually play the game.

Bound by Flame,PlayStation 4,79,79,"Bound by Flame, a fantasy RPG brought to us by Spiders Studio, is something of a mixed bag of good and bad points but overall, I have found it to an be enjoyable and a solid RPG experience. It's not as deep as Skyrim (huge fan), but it is very similar to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning in my opinion.

Story: You play as a mercenary who becomes possessed by a demon that grants him the ability to wield the power of fire in the midst of a war against the Deadwalker Army, but you must decide what's more important to you...your humanity, or the ever expanding powers of the demon. Every choice you make could make you a hero, or become more of a reflection of the demon possessing you, therefore, affecting those around you.

Gameplay: Combat is definitely one of the strongest points of Bound by Flame. During combat, you have the ability to change your ""stance"" between a Warrior or a Ranger on the fly and allowing you to approach or adapt to the situation in front of you. Using the Warrior stance allows you to use swords, battleaxes, or hammers and are capable of dishing out lots of damage, but the attacks are relatively slow and if facing an agile enemy, you could find yourself getting hit and possibly interrupting your attacks. The Ranger stance allows you to use daggers as your primary weapon and to become very nimble, focusing more on quick, consecutive strikes while being able to evade enemy attacks but if facing a group of enemies, the weaker strikes means more damage needing to be dealt and more time for you to be overrun.

Exploration is similar to KOA: Reckoning as it's an open world but you're not entirely allowed to go ""everywhere"" like Skyrim. The areas that you visit each have their own distinctive feel but nothing too stunning that really makes them memorable.

Another part of combat is the decision if you want to bring a companion along with you. Personally, I've found your companions to be lacking in combat and they make better meatshields than fighters. I find myself doing most of the dirty work while my companion is getting stomped more than the I in the Pixar logo before movies.

Customization: One of the other strong points of Bound by Flame is it's customization options for your armor and weapons. Throughout the game, you collect raw materials like metal and leather and you can take those and enhance armor or weapons you receive from chests or enemies. Each customization option has a different appearance compared to other options and grants different bonuses as well so, you can find one that suits your style the best and make your own unique piece of equipment.

Music: I find the soundtrack of the game to be a little overbearing during the game and especially during cutscenes so, I would recommend going into the Options and turning down music volume so you can listen more to the dialogue and sounds of battle than the music. Even with this small complaint, I still found the soundtrack to be decent, especially during boss battles.

Voice Acting/Dialogue: One of the weaker points of Bound by Flame. I found some characters to be lacking in emotion during some situations but it's not as bad as what some people have said in my opinion. Merchants and others NPCs say the same thing, every time you speak to them, even if it's literally 2 seconds apart unless you progress past a certain point in any side quest or main story mission that involves them. I also found dialogue options to be kind of lacking as you can ask someone questions to get some answers to a quest you are on, but after you finish that quest, you can select an option that was open previously available and the only option after that is, ""Let's talk about something else."" It's almost like a waste of breath and time.

Summary: Overall, I am giving Bound by Flame an 8/10. I think it's a solid entry for Spiders Studio and a satisfying entry for RPG enthusiasts who were looking for a small fix on the PS4 that didn't want to invest in FFIV: A Realm Reborn, like me. It has it's flaws, but the strong combat, nice customization, and a decent story make up for them. If you enjoyed KOA: Reckoning or Fable, then I would recommend you giving Bound by Flame a shot.

Jagged Alliance: Back in Action,PC,79,79,"A cheap and of low quality copy of JA 2, not reaching even a fraction of its qualities. Same story, same map, terrible face models, ubiquitous copy&paste and inappropriately cut and simplified content of the original game. Messed gun names. Typos. Bugs.

Few copy&paste examples: The A.I.M. terms are word by word taken from JA 2, including the article 2.0 ""Length of Engagement"" and daily, weekly and bi-weekly time periods (from JA 2) regardless it was simplified to a lump sum payment in JA:BiA. The biography of mercs are word by word taken from JA 2, regardless there are different traits in JA:BiA (so while you can read ""heavy wepons are his specialty"" in his bio, the merc is actually melee expert).

If you're still looking for an ultimate argument for how bad this game is, here it is: All the mercs carry their guns unloaded, magazines out. Anytime they reach for a knife, they unload their gun and detach any accesory (silencer, scope) from it first. For their own safety. Nobody want a merc to accidentally shoot his leg, right?

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,PC,498,498,"So overall, I'll give this game a 9.9/10. One of the best games I've EVER played!

I'll start with what made this game not a full 10/10 for me. First, disappointments:

- I was very frustrated with the fact that every time I died, I had to wait about 5-6 minutes waiting and watching all of my enemies become promoted and get even stronger. I kept thinking to myself ""Well if I died to this guy before because he was too hard, now it will be impossible to kill him! He got an upgrade!"" It was amazing and something I've never seen in any other video game. Very dynamic and calls for some high tactical decisions, which is cool and fun! Although highly frustrating at the same time.

- It took a while to get used to the controls, and set up controls/settings in the beginning. I have an above average gaming computer, and I hated the look of Medium graphics and High was too much. Had to toy with it myself for a good hour before playing, and disabling VSync improved my performance (with the downside of having some screen tearing). Also spent another half an hour figuring out how to set the key bindings, because I do like to play with controls that I'm used to and familiar to.

- The final boss fight was meh. I was expecting something bigger! Some incredibly dificult fight that I would die hundreds of times before finally killing him and screaming ""YES!!!"", making the neighbors think that I have tourettes. It was some disappointing ""Press this button. Okay now press this button. Finally press this button. Congrats, you've won!"" I mean, really? Come on, at least give me a challenge! I've fought Captains more difficult than the Black Hand of Sauron! Heck, a regular Uruk is more difficult!

Even though these things made my game experience a little lacking to it's full potential, there are many many things that I really enjoyed about this game!

+ This game is a mix between LOTR/Hobbit story universe, Assassin's Creed roaming and adventure style, and any recent Batman game's combat.

+ There are abilities which change how the game is played completely! The ""shadow strike to mount a Caragor/Graug"" ability is badass. Super quick too.

+ I love how the Uruks ranks work, and I loved seeing and helping Ratbag (who was completely unworthy to ever be an Uruk to begin with) become Warchief. Branding all of the Captains and Warchiefs is something I haven't done yet, but I think I can do it now.

+ The story itself. I loved how even though I am not Talion, the game **** me into the story and really feel the hurt that Talion feels when anyone mentions his emotions putting weight into his step, and making his combat sloppy, or when any Black Captain mentions his wife and son. The feels are real.

+ I've been waiting for this game for about a month now, freaking out over any new content made. Usually when I do this to a game, it gets disappointing to play because I know it all. Not this game, it really pulled it together and made me love the game even more!",10,2014-10-04,Vornim,True
Kingdom Hearts III,PlayStation 4,654,500,"I have been a fan of KH since KH2. I played almost all the numbered titles and the handheld games. KH3 is a very KH-ish game yet there is something fresh in it just like every game in the series. I found the game very enjoyable. I was ready to be disappointed by this game since some fans seems to dislike it for some reasons. After I played it, tbh I found it very good and found many critiques toward the game are just exaggerating. I was mostly impressed by the amount of details put into every world. It just felt alive. Yoko Shimomura did it again with the ost and I just love seeing Sora and the gang having fun in the game.

Twisted Metal (2012),PlayStation 3,122,122,"Competitive combat perfection. If you are a fan of the Twisted Metal series this is indeed the game you have been waiting for. It offers the finest mix of gameplay features and stage design in the series, taking the best elements of prior Twisted offerings (including characteristics of Twisted Metal 1 and Rogue Trip). The gameplay is tight and very well balanced, with well adjusted special weapons which now feature alternative fire modes, and offers the best mix of weapon pickups in the series. The story mode offers only three characters, but the actual structure is largely an improvement on past iterations with more varied gameplay offerings such as cage matches and endurance modes rather than 100% death match. The boss fights are a thing of intense beauty, they will get your heart pumping. Some may or may not like the battle race mode (think Death Race/Carmeggedon), but once you get used to it it's very fun and challenging and represents the best this sub-genre has to offer. There are a few other notable changes, such as making ""energy moves"" (freeze, mine, shield) mapped to the directional pad instead of requiring a combo string as in previous iterations. This really helps to make the game more accessible to newcomers and is frankly a welcome change. These moves also have alternate fire modes by holding the Triangle-button, though you have to unlock them through story mode. Series veterans be warned though - shields now last a fraction of their previous duration and you will have to adapt to new strategies with the lighter armored vehicles. This change is probably healthier for the game as a whole as shield barrages (shield up, drive in, and unload entire weapon bay) became the de facto strategy far too often in previous games, though I do wish shields lasted about half of a second longer.

The game offers profound replay value in both the offline and online realms. Those wishing to play solo against the AI can play several different game modes such as traditional deathmatch, cagematch (where combatants must fight in a ""cage"" area that moves on a timer), battle race, and nuke (sort of like capture the flag but with more steps). There is an online leaderboard and ranking system that is sure to be a hit with series veterans who just want to see how good they think they are. The multiplayer is robust, offering clan-systems and in-game updates to see when your friends online for structured play as well as providing a quick match feature if you're just looking for some fast action.

Graphically, the visual quality is on par with other AAA PS3 titles of this nature. The framerate is incredibly fluid and never dips at even the most chaotic moments. The art design is fantastic and each car has it's own unique look and feel, which represents the series well. The color schemes used for the stages are quite varied and offer something different that makes each environment feel unique. Special effects such smoke and flames also look great.

The music features a roughly even split of licensed tracks and tracks made specifically for the game. On the whole, it is a great soundtrack featuring a heavy dose of hard rock and metal with a suitably vehicular centric theme. Sound effects are generally fantastic; the missiles and gunfire sound truly intimidating and both are functional and immersive.

All in all, the game is simply fantastic. The variety of vehicles and playstyles, incredible stage design, and enhanced ruleset all add up to a Twisted Metal experience that is frankly, the best the series has to offer. If you are a fan of competitive action games that require expert timing and advanced spatial reasoning, this is your new go-to game. You simply cannot get as fine of a car combat experience anywhere else.",10,2012-02-15,Lobstros,False
No Man's Sky,PC,868,500,"I'm dropping my score to 0, after my dismal rating of 4. Why?  Looks like the developers couldn't care less to fix up their mess.
By this time, other game developers explain themselves or at least talk about a plan, what to expect in the near future, regarding adding content and making their game more enjoyable, but Hello Games don't even bother to write patch notes, let alone give a pulse sign on social media or their official website.
People who didn't refund and waiting patiently are left in the dark. The last patch (1.09) takes more away from the broken, but manageable gameplay there was, by patching up the ""glitch"" , which allowed people to stack similar items, even though people were asking for a function to stack similar items!!  Unbelievable!
Others report, that their discoveries they made are wiped from their record, while some others complain about worse framerate.
At this point, the whole game is nothing more, but a buggy software to make screenshots. But first, make sure you get a 3rd party screenshot maker, because the game doesn't have one.

Ashen,PC,72,72,"Pros: +Graphics +Art +Sound +Story
Cons: -Combat -Controls -AI

""LIGHT SOULS?"" Let's address the DS comparison. I played through and enjoyed the Souls games but I'm not a diehard fan so I feel I can be objective here. They took the ""you will die a lot"" part **** completely missed the ""learn attack patterns / mechanics and feel a sense of accomplishment afterwards"" part. The difficulty is not something you can learn from and conquer, it's just unbalanced. Also, your AI companion is terrible and usually gets in the way. For such a graphically polished game, there are a lot of bugs.

The story is interesting and it does have a lighter, polished tone. I love the world this game builds. The graphics are great, art style is beautiful, sound design is top notch.

I do believe most main reviewers hyped it up a bit too much before fully exploring it. There are glaring control and gameplay flaws. Control: a couple issues with the way the keys are bound. Completely counter-intuitive. This isn't a PC port so the controls should have 100% flexibility but you can't even remap those keys properly. Gameplay: Weapons and stats are unbalanced - instead of inviting different playstyles it forces you to choose between the ""strongest"" choice or a weaker one. Not to mention a huge lack of variety between weapons & armor.

Now usually I'm a ""enjoy the game as a whole, don't worry about the small stuff"" kind of guy, but personally I couldn't move past these issues.

GOOD GAME FOR:
-Fans of art, story and graphic design
-Casual ""pick em up start playing"" and ""put them down and move on"" type

BAD GAME FOR:

The graphics in this game are outstanding for most of it. The gunplay is tight and the ability to make upgrades is a good addition. It never felt repetitive in my opinion. I'll say the worst part of the game is the water... I mean seriously, was the person in charge of water graphics on vacation for the entire development?

Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U,3DS,280,280,"Largely the weaker of the two Smash 4 versions, as its graphics seem kind of rough by 3DS standards and the stage choices felt weaker.

The only advantage this game really has over the Wii U version is that Smash Run is a much better mode than Smash Tour, although even then it feels a bit lackluster and not particularly well thought out.

Other than that, the 3DS and Wii U versions have very little difference from each other. Their choices for new characters was, in general, a bit questionable at times. The stages were sometimes poorly designed and they didn't seem to understand the desires of competitive or casual players, as almost every stage is extremely over-complicated, with gimmicks and movement directly affecting the gameplay, whereas the ""Omega"" version that is offered overly simplifies the stages into generic, flat planes. The Fire Emblem and especially Kid Icarus franchises are over-represented to the arguable detriment of other franchises.

Subnautica: Below Zero,PC,86,86,"I was so excited for this game, but the moment they did the dev reveal stream it all went downhill. Instead of the mysterious eerie feeling of the first part, they jumped on the SJW bandwagon and presented some highly implausible characters for diversity reasons.
Although they tried to tune the annoyance level down since the reveal, the hastily rewritten ""new"" story and the protagonists are still subpar, for example we now have a black lesbian super-scientist who found the cure for an alien disease that a super-high-tech alien couldnt. Also the alien blew everyone up, but it becomes your friend for no reasons. WTF.

The story line basically consists of scanning a dozen of glowing green items in a row. ""oh, you scanned a shiny green thing? here, let me add the location of the next shiny green thing to the map!"". Incredibly boring.

Also, the new mechanics are few and far between, and the amount of assets added does not really warrant a standalone sequel for this price. The game design feels unfinished, I was so excited to finally get the prawn suit, but you actually never need it and can finish the game easily without it. Of the 5 or so seatruck modules, I only needed 1. The rest is completely useless.

Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,PlayStation 5,122,122,"The game brings many things in the MMO ganre to a new level and that how it should be done.

- We know questing in MMO is boring, every MMO player would agree on that one. The idea to place the entire story in dialogs, cinematics and few mini games is amazing. And this decision would not be good if they didn't wrote one of the best stories ever. It was just a great finale for both the Zodiark/Hydaelyn saga and the first chapter.

- New zones are absolutely stunning. At first it was quite strange that some of them are existing only in the main story and will not be lore friendly to go back there, but that gave them the freedom to do insane things with those zones. Totally stunning design.

- Music is master piece. This the only MMO that I just can't play with spotify instead of its original audio and even so, this expansion was above expetations (I still don't like the trailer song, but everything else was stunning).

- Dungeons solo quests and trials were designed **** was pretty good introduction of all basic mechanics that will help to the new players in the future challanges.

I can see how the free ios version of the game offers in-app purchases because the game is free to download. But, this is PS4 and I spent a lot of money on this game. I will never pay for upgrades on a game which costs this much to play.

What a greedy company! Come on EA Sports! Can you not understand how to make a game which your users will enjoy without trying to drain every last dime from their pockets? When money becomes your only priority, and you loose sight of your customers priority (which is to have fun gaming), you loose!

Assassin's Creed Syndicate,PC,256,256,"I’ve always felt that what Ubisoft does best is create spectacular environments that perfectly recreate old or even ancient towns, cities etc. Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is no exception to the rule. The Victorian London setting is absolutely gorgeous and full off detail, but it can’t compensate for every other thing the game does somewhat poorly.
First off, the story is without a doubt disappointing from start to finish. The writing is bad and the characters felt really uninteresting to me. Evie’s relationship with Jacob is the standard brother-sister connection which we’ve seen many times in the past and it gets old really quickly. The game also suffers from the usual Ubisoft side mission recipe, meaning that there are little to no interesting side missions offered here.
However I would say that the gameplay is pretty good overall. Combat is pretty satisfying, stealth works good most of the time and free running is also good. Not saying that everything gameplay related is flawless, but in hindsight there’s nothing major to complain about here.

South Park: The Stick of Truth,Xbox 360,92,92,"After delays and THQ closing and the project going to Ubisoft, South Park The Stick of Truth is released now (yes I know this review is late). For me, just hearing that is was being made by Obsidian was a delight. Enough of that, let's get to the real review. I have played it and beat it, and in my opinion, The Stick of Truth (TSoT) is enjoyable, irritating at times, hilarious, and is one of the best licensed games ever. Most of the flaws come from irritation, yes. However, there are 2 things in this game that are constantly amusing, ALL THE TIME. Those 2 things are the battle system and the humor. While the battle system starts off simple, it goes on to have a layer of complexity, too. It keeps you on your toes with timed button presses that I actually found great, except the small quick time events at times. The magic spells could've been easier to control, too. The classes in the battle system can be different, but the differences aren't as big as you'd expect, especially coming from Obsidian. Even the RPG mechanics are slight. This wasn't a problem though, because it still comes out as enjoyable. However, we all know this is South Park at heart, and that means there will be humor. How is it? It kept on making me laugh, even in the slightest moments. It's wonderfully crude, and yes, it has its offensive side to it, too. One part in the game very close to the end had me laughing constantly, and it was pretty offensive. You may not like the humor, but if you have ever laughed at South Park, you're going to love it. Plus, the story doesn't even need to be good because it's so funny. I found the story to be a bit better than I expected, though (out of South Park at least). The game also has a fair share of replay value. There are side quests, many collectibles, and some very good achievement and trophy hunting. However, with the side quests, I didn't found them very entertaining. There's so many things that block you in the quests, and most of them are kill or fetch quests. This kept me from doing many of them, which I usually do in these kind of games. With the rare occasion of side quests and beating the main story, it took me about 12 to 13 hours. Does that mean it's worth full price? With the enjoyment you'll get, it's worth 40 to 50 dollars. An 8 out of 10, and that is great on my scale.",8,2014-06-18,SimpleReviewz,False

Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft,PC,625,500,"Hearthstone is the best online CCG currently available on the market. It's a game that's VERY easy to get into yet as you get more cards it gradually builds upon it's self.

First off I would like to point out that anyone who is calling this game pay to win is someone you should not listen too. It is entirely possible to get every card in the game without paying a single cent. And it is entirely possible to get to legendary rank using free cards. Now many people will claim that you can just buy a bunch of packs and get a bunch of legendaries. But pretty much every legendary is highly situational, so just having 10 legendaries doesn't actually help you, and in fact it's rather counter productive.

Now that that's out of the way we can get to the rest of the game. I would like to first start off by saying that Hearthstone just oozes polish. Everything about the impact of a high attack creature slamming into an enemy hero to the glorious effects of the spells. You can just see the effort that was put into the game.
The next thing I would like to commend the game on is it's resource system. Instead of having manna cards that you draw in a game like magic, you simply get one manna per turn until you reach 10. This get's rid of some of the RNG that plagues many card games, but of course it still has some RNG...because ****'s a card game. But it's still a great improvement.  Hearthstone also has a very deep meta. As  I stated hearthstone starts off relatively simple and then gradually becomes more complex. Due to the unique play style of all the classes you see a lot of diversity and meta shifting which adds a lot to the game's longevity. And with more cards coming i our future, I see Hearthstone being around for a while.

All in all hearthstone is fantastic and I highly recommend giving it a download. And even if you end up not liking it for whatever reason, it's free! So there's no reason to not give it a try.",10,2014-04-05,Raidriar,False
Dark Souls II,PC,591,500,"After playing the painful, ugly port of Dark Souls 1, I was worried about 2.  However, every single nitpick I had with the first game's gameplay/systems and its PC port, especially the too dark, too muddy graphics has been addressed in the sequel.  This game has put a bug in my brain in the best way possible.  It has me addicted like Metroid/Bioshock/Resident Evil 4 and the satisfaction of designing new characters and finding new secrets and paths is very high.  More so than DS1, I feel like when I die it was my fault thanks to the smoother combat for all types.  It seems like the ""cheap"" kills from the first have been toned down in favor of higher skill combat (for instance, smaller parry windows, different sorcery timing and stamina use, and more difficult backstabs), which is an improvement.  All in all, that sense of exploration and discovery combined with excellent risk/reward gameplay and combat is what makes the ""Souls"" games such a hit and this game has that in spades while also retaining the challenge of the series (difficulty-wise, all 3 ""Souls"" games feel roughly equal to me, but 2 was the first time I've died mostly in combat rather than environmental issues).  I still don't give a crap about the world or characters-except Gavlan and Melentia- but when the gameplay, graphics, and loot are this good, it matters little to me.  Enjoy!

Note: Love all the cry babies giving this poor reviews for the PC port because they want to play everything with a keyboard and mouse.  That's great, go play a dang FPS or MMO but you are truly an idiot to be expecting precision controls in a third person game on KB+M.

It is utterly charming and looks awesome  can't deny either of those things, but it does feel like it takes an age for the world to open up and allow you to explore more freely. The battles over the first few hours pose little to no challenge which makes a cool battle system get a bit old before it finally starts to open up several hours in.

Metroid Fusion,Game Boy Advance,95,95,"I played this game 6 years ago when I bought a 3DS. I decided to replay it in anticipation of the new Metroid game coming out this weekend. I've not played any Metroid game other than this one, and while I anticipated the plot to be light, I didn't realize it would result in the game being only about 10 hours long (4:45 on my playthrough- I guess I died a lot?). A lot of the game seems to be involved in finding secrets, but I found this to be more tedious than enjoyable- basically, I found myself throwing bombs at every wall and floor in hopes of finding a secret, or a place to advance the level. In fact, it seems that at least once every level you have to bomb an inconspicuous part of the wall in order to advance, or find a secret corridor as a ball. It didn't make me like the game any more, which made me wish it had been more straightforward and less frustrating. I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable, although one-sided. Samus is a killing machine, but she takes a lot of damage when she gets hit. Luckily, most of the enemies don't have ranged attacks, so it's easy to avoid most damage. Boss fights were slightly more challenging- basically, I would spend one life in order to find the bosses weakness, die, load my save, and then abuse the weakness through brute force. Not too difficult, until the final boss, which provided a real challenge. Overall, I enjoyed the game and its mechanics (due to the quick pace of the game, upgrades came fast and furious, which was enjoyable), but I hope that the new 3DS game coming out introduces something a little beyond what we see here.",7,2017-09-16,birdman3,False

The Evil Within,PC,287,287,"Definitely NOT a survival horror.
Not even a horror game.
Poor storytelling. You spend your time to don't know what you're doing and why you need to do it.
Poor level design. You spend your time to don't know where you are or where you go. You feel lost every-time, and, actually, you are. Enemies are awful, they're buggy and have terrible collisions. You spend your time fighting bosses, one after the other, like in a beat'em'all. You cannot play 5 minutes without having an enemy jumping in front of you.
Poor game design. No, this it not like ""old survival horror games"". There is a huge difference between having not much ammo and dodging enemies, and having no ammo and being forced to kill every single enemy. Enemies see you, even when you don't see them. Doors are closed until you killed everyone. Enemies loot stuff.
That's not fun at all.

What really grinds my gears are the developers lies. Oh sure, we could meet other players, yes there is a multiplayer! Expect IT IS NOT POSSIBLE.
Oh and did you watched the old trailer of this game, with the world covered in animals, plants and trees? With space combat of the large ships between races? Forget it, it was all scripted for the need of poor marketing, hype building.

There are all sorts of crazy weapons to find, like full-auto shotguns, flamethrowers and armored battle suits that can tear through any **** stupid enough to get in your way.

- The game is quite linear, not much player choice

Overall - Not the most long lasting extensive gameplay ever, but still highly recommended that everyone who enjoys the art of video games. Most likely will play it a couple times and on special occasions.

Destiny: The Dark Below,PlayStation 4,97,97,"I'm officially done with Destiny. I can't fathom why in 2014 we are being handed a game with the biggest capital investment of ANY game to date that has less content then a private indie developed game. The base game had NO content, NO Story, NO Replay, NO REAL competitive multiplayer experience so you would naturally think there would be some sort of admission of wrong-doing by bungie in the first exspansion. Well..there isn't. Bungie almost flaunts the fact that they only have to put out a few hours worth of content to warrant fanboys praise. The Dark Below is an unethical cash grab. Still NO story, NO new characters (if you think Eris is a character I honestly don't know what to say) and NO replay. There is one new enemy, recycled world zones, new ""ships"" (just a pretty overlay for your 3 minute long loading screen) Additionally, there's the new raid which has been beaten within 6 hours of the release. It would be wise of anyone who is involved with this franchise to view the debriefing of an insider dev. that was released on reddit. The dev. goes on to say that most of the game was cut prior to release due to turbulence in the company, including, most of the story. How can a company who values its fans release this game for $60, and then release an exspansion (which is all content that should have been in the base game) and charge an additional $20? Bungie needs to answer for the blatant consumer misleading and rectify this trainwreck **** or they will easily take the crown that EA games so shamefully wears. And before anyone disregards this review as an attempt at bottoming the review score please realize I have put 270 hours into this game and have already CLEARED The Dark Below. I feel like as a fellow gamer I have to let the community I love know that this game is not worth the investment you will put in it, even if its only a few hours.",2,2014-12-09,pago2,False

I really wish more people would just try it out. To me, it's quite simply distilled fun.

Halo 3: ODST,Xbox 360,165,165,"a $20 game sold for $60

very mediocre and short single player, not worth replaying at all.

Firefight is a new mode where  you basically play horde mode, but you litterally play the same waves of enemies in the same order and getting the achievements takes forever. it's mind numbing an tedious.

doesn't have it's own multiplayer vs mode, just gives you halo 3 again, wow thanks I have halo 3 and it's DLC like every other fan of the series.

I know this review is years late but people are talking about it again since halo 4 was bad and considered the worst in the series, but many forget how bad ODST was. worst in the series, WORSE than halo 4.",3,2013-07-11,usrevenge,False
